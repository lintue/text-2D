-4.918818473815918;11.796785354614258;1;Thanks for coming together in this very special way that we've just talked about the fact that it's still a little bit strange for us to meet you through the screen, and that we are still  learning these new ways of gathering people together. 
-1.1452007293701172;7.013077735900879;1;I think it would be nice to talk a little bit about us and about Irruptive Chora, because I think with some of you we have worked in the past, but not everyone I think is familiar. So just to keep it short. We were laughing today, because I got asked that maybe I should tell this story. At some point, when we were running a radio show, this story got recounted so many times. But now I realise that I actually I think I haven't told it for like three years. So there is the story we met during, we didn't really meet, we knew each other. But we met again, after sometime, as it happens, when we have these, like, meetings. Knowing each other, then something happens during a reading group in the ICA. And that was after I graduated from the RCA and Agata was in her final year and just graduated, we were in this reading group. And I think the subjects we kind of touched upon during the group really resonated with us. And we thought that it would be nice to do something together. And maybe it started with an idea to maybe run a reading group and continue this conversation in our own time and facilitate these meetings with other people. And then this grew into something much bigger, a project that has been running for like, three years now. And the reading group never happened. But we did start with five performative events. And then from then on, we did different like radio broadcasts, exhibitions and performances.
-1.5795300006866455;8.05198860168457;1;I think it's important to say that we started with an idea of a reading group, because we were thinking about language, in itself, trying to think of ways of expanding limits of language. And I think it's important to say it now, because our collaboration started with a text and also during this project, we will be kind of playing around with spoken language,  transcribing language and also with artificially produced language by machines, digitally constructed human language. So there is a thread of communication, yes, I mean, indicating through language, but also finding new ways of communicating with not only human beings. 
-4.174915790557861;-17.057674407958984;1;Which I think leads to this other thing, initially, all the things that we've been doing, were very much about gathering together physically, everything came from the actual thematics that started with thinking about coming back to the body and like the embodiment of different states, and just generally working a lot with the body and then slowly kind of moving towards a lot of sonic work and, and then we found ourselves in the pandemic. And I think that was kind of like a catalyst to push further these explorations, how can we still keep working and find other ways of working with people. And what could that be? And the process was quite long, because like, now we're, it's been two years, right, since the beginning of the pandemic exactly to me, but the project has been growing for a year now. I think it's going to be something else now than what we thought it would have been a year ago. 
2.9128518104553223;3.5235159397125244;1;But that's also nice, we do come back, we move away from the idea and we come back again, I think this this cycling and nonlinear way of thinking about time that is  also related to our last project that we organised just before pandemic and some of you took part in it was called recovery. It was a project that was also very much focused on exploring totally process based activity. So It was a three weeks long residency and evolving exhibition that explored the theme of recovery. And also thought about its process and the fact that it's never, never a closed set cycle. It's never a circle, it's, it's going backwards that happens when we move into the future. And  I'm mentioning it now, because layering and non linearity will be a big part of the virtual space that we want to create between us. And also, the whole project that we invite you to, is about, it's about process. It's a research research project with no predefined outcomes, predefined ideas, but of getting together as its core purpose of thinking, making, sharing. And learning from each other as its main focus.
1.6265274286270142;2.7518534660339355;1;We're talking a lot about ourselves. But that actually brings us to the point that the main aim was just to bring people together, and maybe and engage in a project that would be more long term that would allow us to come back to these relationships that we're building for a project, unlike in the past, where it was very encounter-based, but but kind of, we felt that there was a continuity lacking. And that's what we wanted to achieve, maybe or try to achieve with this project.
-1.9486664533615112;2.056342840194702;1;And also we never were based in any one specific place. We were a nomadic platform. So we always moved between institutions and different physical spaces. And we thought that the digital space would grant us some kind of sustainability.
18.713275909423828;-4.497646808624268;1;Yeah. And autonomy as well.
18.249940872192383;-5.173726558685303;1;Independence. Yeah.
1.3890632390975952;-6.427123069763184;1;But I think, shall we ask maybe. So basically, I think this session, like we just wanted to hear about what you've been doing and thinking and making recently and like, how could you imagine participating in this project? What is there that you would specifically maybe want to think about or like, get from it, just just kind of like loose faults, really. And also to get to know each other? Because we know most of you. But I don't think everyone knows each other.
2.985889434814453;9.747446060180664;1;So I remember that we shared some themes that we wanted to cover during the peer group sessions. But we would like to hear any ideas that you are occupied with, because this is a collective creation. And as there's no final preconceived outcome, we want this process to be shaped as we go on. 
-5.521686553955078;0.8481305837631226;1;So it would be great just to hear from you because some of you, I think, we started the conversation more than half a year ago. So maybe things changed as well. And where you're at now and what you're doing.
-15.560524940490723;10.887344360351562;1;Exactly where are you? What are you working with? What are your anxieties? What are your ambitions? Would anyone like to start?
11.715924263000488;6.769262790679932;1;Maybe? awkwardly, but we were thinking how to avoid this, but then. But then it would be, it just would be really nice to hear from all of you and hear everyone's voice.
8.176656723022461;17.38385581970215;1;Okay, so maybe Erik wants to start, but I think we are maybe, yep. Erik is gonna say on his own, about his role in the project. Cool. Yeah. Thanks. Thank you for volunteering. 
-5.937873363494873;-11.5740327835083;1;Hey, can you hear me and see me? Yep. Cool. So I'm Erik. I'm working on this project as I'm building the digital platform. So if you have any, if you have any ideas or questions about that, at Any point, just let me know. So I thought I'd just tell you where I'm at, what I'm doing, what I've been doing. And yeah, I've been a bit busy this week. So I'm just a bit out of it. So sorry about that. I'm trying to share my screen. Can you see my screen? Yes. Cool. Okay, so at the moment, I'm working. I'm in Helsinki. I studied at the RCA. I graduated in, I think it was 2021 or 2020. And now I'm in Helsinki, and I am working this year as a research assistant at the Finnish Centre for artificial intelligence. Some AI research. And I come from a background in. In sound art, I've been working in radio, theatre, and live music. And then from there, I kind of got really interested in working with data, so data sonification data visualisation. And that's how I ended up at the RCA. I studied a course called information experience design. So I'm really interested in how we, how we, how we can kind of work with information, how we represent information, how we experience information. And so that's, that's sort of how I got interested in AI. And so if you see my screen here, and basically like one of the one of the kind of overarching themes and in, in my own work, and in my thinking, is representation representations, so I'm quite interested in how we how we can represent information, whether it's visual, auditory or whether it's language and mostly in, in the context of like AI how we can, how we can kind of how we can represent these, like physical phenomena digitally, so what, what kind of emerges from that system of spearing these digital representations of things into this like weird mathematical, statistical computational system. And then, I'm very interested in how we can kind of come up with systems and interfaces to interpret those systems. So I think the field is known as interpretable machine learning or interpretable AI. So, I'm interested in all kinds of data, visualisations feature visualisations. And as yeah, there's some really cool work being done at the moment with neural nets. For instance, this image here is a generative neural nets. That's been trained on a data set of somebody playing GTA 5. And it's really interesting where in the system, how it works is basically you're controlling you're using a controller to move just move forwards, left, right or backwards, or whatever, I think they might be using a joystick. And then the, the network predicts the imagery that kind of happens based on the based on the movement of the joystick, and what's really interesting here to me is that you're actually not inside a game engine like you would be so basically you'd use if you would be playing a game you'd be in this like 3d game engine. And when you move when you make the movement on your controller it would be rendered into an image. Whereas like this is a neural net that's kind of learned a representation of the physics engine that would be used in the. So it's basically like, a neural net has just learned basically, it's like a game engine. And it's really weird. And it would be interesting to know how it kind of works. So, I mean, these are the kinds of things I'm quite intrigued by generally. But yeah, mostly I work with things like data visualisations and, and thinking about interfaces for interfacing with information in these machine learning systems. And, yeah, that's pretty much it. So from this project, I just want to experiment with the platform. So different ways of interfacing with information and, and seeing what comes out. And I'm kind of treating it as my own artistic contribution to the project. So we're going to be publishing it as this very plain, empty-ish kind of site, and then just kind of shaping it as we move along with these peer group sessions, and the project in general, so. So yeah, looking forward to meeting you all, and yet, sorry that I'm just completely out of it. Tonight. I'm sure we'll have lots of opportunities to get to know each other better.
5.499353408813477;17.550107955932617;1;And there's a question, Erik, how is this neural network called?
-1.5626018047332764;-4.298370361328125;1;So basically, this is a general generative adversarial network again, I don't actually know much about it, because it's not a project that I've worked on. But it's just something that I've seen recently. That's like, super interesting. And they've called it just Gun Theft Auto instead of Grand Theft Auto. So I think you'll be able to find some information on it based on that, but it's but it's again, that's like that's what they're using, but it's and I can actually just write in Yeah. Don't let somebody else introduce themselves. And if you have any more questions, just let me know. Thank you.
-3.329556465148926;20.386507034301758;1;Anyone else wants to continue? Okay, shall we go by our screen? Yes. Do do we introduce how we know each other maybe?
-6.65229606628418;14.16699504852295;1;Okay, we can like ease in. So the first person on our grid is Sara. So we were talking quite a bit recently, because we've just recorded a broadcast with Sara. And Sara was also part of the our last pre pandemic project Recovery she performed. 
6.900550842285156;7.599039554595947;1;So would you like to say a few words about your current project Landra because we will be also leading a workshop that is related to your new life, your practice there, and maybe it would be interesting to hear how you are doing and what is it? What is it about?
-4.284731864929199;9.956827163696289;1;I mean, for us, it was one of the reasons to bring you to this particular project because it's like, an actual embodiment of the idea of searching for new ways of existing, basically. So it's really exciting to hear about it.
-10.482437133789062;-16.209941864013672;1;Sure. Yes. Thank you for inviting me in. Hi, everyone. Um, can you hear this noise or is it just annoying me? It's good. So I'm just like a kind of brief introduction. I'm from Portugal, but I lived in London for more than 10 years. Graduated from a MFA at Goldsmiths. Although I've studied music before, as well, so I'm kind of in the interdisciplinary group, as probably most of you also are, it's kind of in between zones. I worked a lot on researching how we humans relate to kind of macro systems, but also microsystems relating to our own environments, and how these environments also have repercussions around the world and how all this kind of connectivity pans out and in contemporary society. And maybe I could share my screen as well. I'll share my screen. Yes. And so I guess, when I was in London, I was looking a lot more into these kinds of macro systems because of how London is connected and how our way of life is ultimately shaped by all these kinds of global connections of trade, and, and products and services. And so I was looking a lot more into global systems. This is called ‘Degrees of Abstraction’. And so I start with these kinds of graphs that then open up into actual soil, and I was researching things such as pesticides, herbicides, land deals, and kind of this unravelling of processes. Yeah, um, and so but since I kind of came back to Portugal, I came back, kind of in the beginning of the pandemic, but not necessarily because of the pandemic. So the idea was really, because I was kind of delving into all these ecological questions. We, me and my partner really felt the need to kind of go closer to the land and really work with the land, something we didn't think was possible much in London, we did have like a tiny allotment, which was where things kind of started having a more material grasp for us in terms of having this really relation to for example, how we eat and how we produce our basic sustenance. So the moments on our orchard. Oh, hello. Oh, did you lose me?
-14.472448348999023;10.857817649841309;1;Am I exactly lost, you? Know, digitised robotic voice.
-9.570889472961426;-16.68342399597168;1;Um, yes, I don't work so much with this kind of advanced technology as some of you. It's funny that this happened. But yeah, so I'm kind of, in a way going the other direction not necessarily against kind of the production of new technologies or science, but really kind of going back to the essence of also what it means to be alive and in relation to our ecosystems that are in this day and age being completely degraded and taken off a kind of a more personal relation of ourselves with the rest of the environments, which were a part of, but there's a lot of alienation taking place. And so we decided to go back and really try to and relate to these processes one on one, and so we're kind of living on enough in this land, which had a stone house, but it's kind of derelict, so we're slowly refurbishing it, um, and it's one kilometre down, it's hard to kind of go there by car. And so we started kind of just camping because we weren't sure the house was really livable. And then we got a wood stove. Then we started getting this kind of tiny solar panel just to charge our phones. And so we've been kind of really living all the stages, with kind of, with a basic relief that we need to survive. And we started recognising we did a lot of foraging practice back in London. And that's why we started because it's a practice in London, maybe more than in Portugal in a lot of ways. And so now we recognise most of the plants that are on the land are actually edible, for example, which a lot of people have now forgotten about. Since the kind of industrialization and the kind of rise of huge supermarket chains and these other systems of production, it's also very associated with poverty, and so a lot of people have forgotten about the kind of edible uses and medicinal uses of these planets. We're also building our own kind of solar system, piece by piece. Yeah, we found these batteries that are non toxic, which are nickel ions when they were initially developed by Edison. And that were not commercialised because they were kind of too big, to be marketable, but they're not non pollutant. And by the end of their life, you can even send the kind of water back to the potatoes, and then kind of make them rechargeable again. So that's quite exciting. And the name Ladra comes from, from the word Landras, which was the word for acorns in the north of Portugal and Galicia. And back in the days, people used to eat acorns. And now it's a forgotten practice. But the exciting thing about Acorns is that they obviously come from trees, from Oak trees, and they're perennials and so you don't need to kind of bring the land back to zero every year with annual cultures or monocultures to kind of get your main nutrients or, yeah. So that was something exciting for us in terms of land sovereignty, and kind of working with complex ecosystems and not having to necessarily destroy these ecosystems to survive. I've also done a permaculture course more recently, and so that kind of really brought forward all these interests in a more practical sense. And so I guess I'll just share it once again. So some of my recent projects have been working really with the Portuguese landscapes and, and territory and use of land and sovereignty. I work a lot with performance as well. I think you can kind of see it, these are the these were all these are kind of representative graphs. But the little sticks are representative of a lot of species that we found that have a lot of users. But normally this type of the landscape that we were working with, is normally transformed into monocultures. Normally it's normally said that they need to not have anything around to be productive, which is not necessarily true. And so these landscapes are very kind of monoculture. Now, because of these practices. You can see that in this kind of image here. It's kind of you know, just started off to trees and bare ground. And the space where I'm speaking of now, which was where I was telling you the beginning, this space, which I'm showing now, which was where we kind of did a garden that just looked like a bare patch of soil. And it was hard work to convince the actual institution to transform the space. I did a microbiology course also recently, so we actually have a microscope and were able to analyse the soil from this land, which was very compacted and dry was basically mineral with no very little kind of soil life and like microscopic life to then a an abandoned a lot nearby, which was a prior garden that had a lot of species thriving and in a whole kind of biodiversity ecosystem. And we tried to bring this species back by first kind of re-inoculating the soil and treating them be able to to have these species come back here so that the first column on the left here shows a very mineral soil and more and more you see the more biodiversity that makes your life in the soil from the analysis of the abandoned garden. And then here's things that we grew. And yeah, we made a video. So I work a lot also with performance. And this is a lecture performance specifically. But yeah, I guess this is the website of Landra. So we talked about sovereignty and, and trying to work through the idea of auto sufficiency as much as we can. And I think we're nearly there trying to really push the limits of how much we can. We can really co-inhabit a land and get what we need from it without having to exploit it, to exploit other other systems of production. And we have a space here with practices. So composting, other methodologies such as, yeah, not tribe and cultural agroforestry systems have a little diary, a calendar of the kind throughout the year, a library of some books and other other things. And I guess I'll leave it at that, because it's a lot of us sorry, I really don't know, when I speak how long I take, there we go. Thank you so much.
4.950652122497559;13.226091384887695;1;Looking forward, how we can bring all of this land into our virtual space. Be interesting.
11.760169982910156;-7.219340801239014;1;Activated me with your proposal was how this is all kind of online space, and how to really kind of join these two and make them speak to each other and have us grow together. Because this will be quite some time we spent during these months, it will be interesting to see how this space online and also your land is developing and how your life changed throughout all of these months, and how your interaction is influenced by it. Interesting, thank you so much. Should we move to  the next in our gallery view? So would you like to share any expectations and things that you're working on now?
-2.057450771331787;-15.683784484863281;1;First of all, thank you very much for inviting me. It's really nice being here and seeing some very familiar faces and also some new ones. So yeah, I am working primarily with images still and moving. But also sound and in situ installations. My research surrounds the notions of silence which also corresponds with the project, I think because I'm quite intrigued by the accessibility aspect of it. And silence as a means of transformation and as a practice of exchanging and setting things. I'm also interested in the notion of trace. And all my research includes elements of vernacular architecture, collective memory and folk tradition. With my work, I'm mainly attempting to highlight the significance of the ephemeral space that surrounds us, physical or material, the processes that save the space and how they affect our relation with the land and other beings badly to all data maintaining a teaching practices Well, in and out of the institutional boundaries, I would say. And I often collaborate with Ramona, who is also in our group, as well as with different people in the process of developing ideas and material for educational activities. So yeah, obviously, I'm excited to work with new people from different disciplines that I haven't had the chance to explore so far in my life. So it's quite interesting. And last but not least, coincidentally, also because I saw it in your themes, my whole teaching practice accidentally in the beginning, but now very like, like deliberately is surrounding a lot of neurodiverse practices like working with people that are coming from this background, so yeah, this is also something that resonates with me a lot. Thanks.
6.205279350280762;7.0928568840026855;1;Thank you so much. It happens that Ramona who you collaborate with is next on our gallery grid. Would you like to say a few words about your practice, your expectations of this project, and maybe any relationship with technology that you have? In your work? 
-6.639710426330566;-15.927114486694336;1;Yes, thanks for having me. My practice comes kind of mainly work with photography, in a more physical way. A lot of process and kind of working with spaces and in responsive spaces. So themes of nature, such things, I find in the nature, make, inspired by nature, or also the kind of relationship between humans and animals and kind of your intersection with nature as well. Within the practice, also esoteric set as well, and do a lot of teaching and kind of what I want to explore, I think you mentioned in the beginning, as well as the idea of process and I think in photography it doesn't really go well, because it's really hard to work only with process, because often there's always this desire of the outcome, you know, always you take the image just like the final print, and it's kind of in a space, but there's so much more to it. And I think also working really with non narrative as well. So working with the medium or other also use text as well in the work is, how can I translate? Yeah, certain experiences. And I think that's why it will be really interesting, I guess, bringing technology in as well. Because I think actually, I don't really work much with technology and all these things, I'm interested definitely in themes to, you know, the human, the non human. But for me, it's always been such a material way I explored it. So it might be quite challenging and also work very analogue in a way.
-2.927600145339966;-14.447076797485352;1;I think just, before we move to the next person, I wanted to just expand on what you just said, the fact that your work is very tactile. And just to say that, when we were thinking of all the people, we wanted to invite to the project, the idea was to actually create a quite a diverse group of people who are whose work is very much technology based, or inquiring into different digital technologies, and then have people who are very material base, and see how this can create new dynamics, but also create this exchange between different people in the group translation, and also thinking about translation of how can we actually, this was something that is more connected to the pandemic, and this idea that talking to different people, different artists, friends had very different experiences. And that goes back to the first most the first year of the pandemic, when, when it actually hit everyone. And, there was this feeling that a lot of people just like really, very soon found themselves in these new environments, and were really capable of using them in creative ways. And then there were these other people that didn't really know how, like what to do, like, if my practice is material based, like how do I translate it in a way that's actually engaging and interesting to others. So that's yeah, that was that was also kind of behind the idea for the project to to, to create this horizontal exchange, but also create these this space for people who have very different practices, to to function in this like, hybrid approach that we we kind of want to take.
3.4660825729370117;11.238093376159668;1;I think it's important for us to mention the fact that we always want to remember the digital, it's not a substitute for what we do here. In here. Now in the physical reality, we want to remember that our adventure with technology was about expanding the embodiment, it was something that was really inherent to our bodies. So we want to stay in touch with both the material while still being in the virtual space together. So there will be crossovers.
4.358173847198486;0.18788820505142212;1;And this really, like this was very much at the core of how we were thinking about making the group of people. So yeah, thank you, Ramona, and the next person, Tanya
13.568034172058105;9.914261817932129;1;Hello, can you hear me? Yes, very well
-7.850009918212891;-17.825450897216797;1;be okay accompanying it from my iPhone. My computer doesn't work with a camera. So yeah, I'm Tanya, I'm in London, originally from rural Wales. I was at college with Ania. So we've known each other for quite a few years. I work predominantly with film photography, installation, as opposed in a kind of broadest sense, I'd say, a kind of look at constructive speculative environments. And the relationship of language that informs and distrusts, disrupts these belief systems, and ownership and belonging within these environments. So that's kind of like a very broad term. But I haven't made work for two years since the pandemic happened, really, because I was working full time. And then my father passed away in the middle of it. And I had this like, urgency to create but I didn't quite know how to create because film isn't very intuitive sometimes. So I started writing, which is kind of relatively new for me. So it's kind of a very new part of my practice, which is quite exciting. And I don't really know where to place it, because it's not my world. But I'd say it's between kind of an essayistic auto fiction. And obviously, from going through loss, it's covering all of these themes of life and death, decay, renewal, reincarnation, and the afterlife. And it also very much touches on care, which is kind of what I was thinking very much about this project and care in the digital and remote, which is what was happening as my father was passing away, and the labour of care, and also interspecies care. So I thought this would kind of, yeah, fit into this. But I do want to start going back to film. So I'm kind of trying to work backwards now from voting to the visual again. So that's where I'm at.
-6.803598880767822;-18.48043441772461;1;Thanks. I think that yeah, it's, it's quite interesting that you mentioned care, because that's also something that we, we've really wanted to think about more in lots of different contexts. It's something that also came up and in this radio series that we do kind of parallel to the project. We've been discussing care a lot, not a lot actually, in the limits of like, the one hour it appeared, and it's something that I really want to think about more and I think the project itself has an aim of creating some kind of a support network support structures between us, for us, it will be kind of a base, it's a platform through which we create new friendships, meet others and and this is a kind of technique of care is it will be some kind of care that will go into it. And hopefully, these support structures will be sustained into eternity like the digital is, thank you so much for this sharing. 
-1.6892482042312622;11.590121269226074;1;Sorry, this is outside of our control who's coming after another one but it's peer trust.
-10.78042984008789;2.183931827545166;1;It's the artificial intelligence
1.930351734161377;6.739692211151123;1;I actually saw Pietro’s work last year. And I think I was mostly fascinated by the relationship between the artist as the human and the machine that went into the whole installation. It was a 3d sound installation and the reciprocity between between the inhumane and the human eye. That's why we thought you, you would, you would you would be interested in what we do here. So yes, it would be great to hear as well, what your expectations are and what you're working on at the moment and how technology really figures in your work.
-11.806316375732422;-9.896398544311523;1;For sure. Well, thank you for the introduction. And it's nice to meet you, virtually. So my name is Pietro. I'm originally from Italy. But I've been living in London for a few years. So my, my practice, my practice is sound based mainly by work with sound and programming. So is the boundaries between sound programming, my background is in music. So I think there's always that underlying area, let's say, so all my works kinda end up having some sort of compositional structure that belongs to music in a way. And what I'm interested in, in my practice, which is to explore the boundaries between the animate and the inanimate, and the organic and inorganic lately have been interested in looking at our interaction with the landscape and the changing landscape landscape itself. So sort of considering the landscape as constantly constantly evolving, and, and sort of moving away from the idea of landscape is merely the geographical scenery, let's say, but in an integration of all the entities that live within it, and the the relationship between these entities and the geography, so this landscape is a larger entity. So that's why I was more interested lately in exploring this idea of landscape with computation and with sounds. I'm going to share this screen because it's easy to talk. Where's the button? Sorry, supposed to notice? Can't find it? Somewhere? I can't find it, honestly. Where is it? Now share screen, it's been back and I found it. And so Okay, so some works, maybe that can give a better idea. So all my works kind of tend to have a life of their own. So what I try to do when I create work is to create the sort of compositional systems and systems that they have a life on their own through programming. So I set a simple set of rules for the systems to grow and develop by themselves. For example, this piece of work here is a sort of, it's a projection, but also, that continues growing, and is based on a sort of a series of genetic algorithms, they get informed by solar energies. It's quite a complex system. But essentially, it's this ever growing structure. The starting point of this work was the idea of the hallway, which is basically this, this path that emerges in forests by feet from people walking on it for centuries, and then animals walking on it, and then water goes through it. So it creates this sunken path they're called. So I wanted to create this but in a digital way. So is this algorithm. This is just a still image from it. There's a video somewhere. This was the work in progress. But it basically is like an ever growing structure. As I said, I work mainly with sounds and other work I've done is this piece already, but I'm trying to develop into something bigger, but essentially, it is a sound piece that is generated by a sort of a, it's called the ecosystemic algorithm. It's sort of like an ecosystem, but it's digital. And there are individual parties, this ecosystem that they have a life and they grow there, they learn and they die and when they die, they pass on the information to the younger generations. This is sort of the logic of this ecosystem. And what it tries to do is to sing in tune with each other basically. And there are several voices that grow the dead things. And this is just a score from a piece. Again, another piece just to give a better idea. And this, this was a bit more linear in a way to approach composition because this was basically translating how our body reacts to inflammation when you get heart surgery, it was working with some researchers. So that's why it's quite clinical. But basically your body when you go through heart surgery, sometimes rarely, but sometimes it happens that your body gets inflamed, and they kind of they're not too well, sometimes you die. So I was using the information from these hormones, how they behave with each other, to create a system that sort of mimics the state of these dynamics. And this is the score for it. And again, like the other piece it evolves, and it has a life on its own. This I'm gonna stop sharing. But yes, and in terms of this project, as I said, I am interested in things that grow and the influence on landscape when considering this larger landscape. So maybe this project came, in a way as the landscape, so maybe creating work that can live on. With a life on its own. Yes. Okay, that's me. Sorry for that, too much information.
3.0931293964385986;5.788346767425537;1;Thank you so much. Love to hear more about the depth of this project. Yesterday, like the whole project will be growing on throughout the next 10 months. So it is a process in itself. So I can already imagine an artificial being as part of it. Should we move on? It happened that another is next on our screen. And I saw Ada’s performance years ago. And recently, we got in touch. We were fascinated by project ‘the best facial’ that addresses others working on, I guess I just leave it to you to describe your work between the digital and the physical. And what are your… What are your expectations of this project?
-6.229857444763184;-13.579598426818848;1;Hey, everyone, others so I'm now in London, in I'm actually on the line that split Camden and Btrny two different Councils. And yeah, no, I got it during a performance that I was looking for. I'll share my screen as I'm talking as I was looking through this stone. Oh, sorry. I need to share the other screen, this one? Yeah. So yeah, that's the dome. And so that's the first time I met Agata from there in the performance. And that's and then later meeting at Iklectik during a sound event. And just like, Now, I say thinking of how like, why I'm here how I met each other. I think you have like, it's also what I'm interested in using performance as a way to meet people as a way to get to know each other. And in my practice, I use functioning as a method as a mode of operation of a given reality. So it's like this is a one a fictional character created from another and from there and that got me to see more things to see more possibilities or ways of being and ways of engaging with space with other people with the environment. So Yeah, sorry, I'm kind of thinking What should I say. And so now I'm finishing my PhD in University of Brighton School of Arts and Media practice based visually using performance situated ontology. And especially using fiction as a methodology to create a new mode of being and becoming. And, and the work that Agata mentioned earlier, the rest of the show is something that I've kind of  developed during the pandemic. So I, so this work is a series of one to one participatory facial sessions that I will have with participants. So I invite each individual participant to join me on Zoom and use this virtual touching that I'm referring to I can see here is this kind of touching from my end while they're on the other side of the screen, or their home and then two, so this virtual touching, of using the is way of touching, and also sound together to trigger and to to create a synthetic experience, to some participant told me that they actually feel itchiness when I touch their eyebrow, especially want to slowly stroke like that. And also superimposing their face with different landscapes is different, just footage I have seen during the pandemic to share this way to share, share, share what we see, what we experience, and to interrogate what we can see and experience through this way. So that's the most recent project I've been doing and then recently, from there developing this new possibly in your work, but it's more focusing on process which is what I'm I really, really fascinated with making work it's a process of working with people of like, trying to kind of like keep playing together that kind of process of finding out what what else is there we can play with. So I'm collaborating with this crow grapher, who is actually my old professor from college in my university in the United States. So we're trying to create this virtual Contact Improvisation using the similarity of ‘The Best Facial’, this telematic then as an experience for dancers, in UK and in the States, to interact with each other. So initially, the dancers, with dancers and eventually dancers, and public audience and public audience and the audience using this kind of big string of interaction using telematic tech technology, and that's how I sit with technology that and also is kind of come it came to me during COVID Is is like a craft that I see as I learned that you work with it, I use it. Not necessarily that it's the only thing I work with, but then if something is available, it has its own urgency that kind of needs me to work with it. Or I needed to work with what else? I think that's me at the moment.
11.68435287475586;13.92395305633545;1;Thank you so much. Is there anyone?
12.168041229248047;12.436476707458496;1;Thank you for inviting me. Can you hear me well?
-8.161555290222168;-12.746861457824707;1;Wait, is it better now? Yes, okay. It's okay. It's okay. Right. Okay. So um, yeah, my name is Maja and I studied Photography at RCA. So I guess. Yeah, that's how I know quite a few people over here. And, yeah, although I studied Photography, I feel like right now, I'm kind of working on an intersection of like different media like video, but also photography but as well writing and also I bring quite a lot of elements of sculpture into my work. I guess I'm interested in the physicality of the objects, which is kind of interesting in the context maybe of this peer group just because I think in terms of technology, I'm probably not the person who uses a lot of virtual kinds of things. I will be focused more on tactility and physical, feeling the objects themselves rather than working within the online environment. So I think I'm also like Ramona looking forward to kind of challenging that. And I guess in my practice, I kind of draw a lot on my personal experience of my heritage of being black Polish, Polish and Senegalese, or something that's one could call brownness and maybe interrogating certain sense of otherness, but also maybe not belonging or being in between cultures in that context. I guess I don't have any images to show you on my screen. But I think currently, the work that I've been like, developing sort of only in my head, is just this idea of thinking about the thinking about the hallucinatory vision of arthroscopy in terms of seeing yourself as the other and how can it help that kind of echos in terms of thinking about black identity, or people who are, who are like, have mixed race heritage, in terms of, you know, feeling always kind of, especially when thinking in context of Eastern Europe, and thinking of being like, always visible and kind of always seen as someone else and someone who's not at home, and they own culture? Yeah, I guess. In a nutshell. Yeah. 
-4.030247688293457;-14.30177116394043;1;Thanks, grasping on to what you said exactly what I said to Ramona before, I think this was the same kind of thinking, like, I know, your work. And I know, it's very material based and very tactile. And it's really interesting. What can happen, and, yeah, this is this idea of translation as I got I was talking about it before. Because maybe I mentioned one more thing, before we move to the next person that I thought about in terms of translation, is that when we were kind of conceptualising, the whole project and thinking about all these different things that led us to, to any and decide what we're going to do. One of the things connected to the accessibility aspects of the project was thinking about how we can present medium specific works to people, to disabled people? So for example, how can a visual work be presented to people who can't see without being this very, I think sometimes quite crude, audience simplified or this description like how can we work in a way that these experiences will be on equal level and that this is not just going to be a description of a work but the work in itself and then the project changed a lot in the meantime, but this idea of like, translation of material into digital and like different mediums into other mediums and maybe somehow finding a way of, of synthesising or maybe not synthesising, but like creating these parallel experiences in this online platform is also something that we want to explore. 
-18.099117279052734;-0.4399303197860718;1;So, Natalia disappeared, but I don't know. You're the next one.
-16.676637649536133;-1.0117466449737549;1;Sorry, I'm very frazzled. I have COVID which is wonderful. So I'm, I'm going to be probably short. I am Polish and I live in London. And I don't know how we met, actually, with the old days, but I don't know. 
-0.2661040127277374;10.91219711303711;1;But I think it was on the occasion of this project. But coming across your work through friends of friends, like friends participating in the same exhibitions, I think or something like that.
-10.457846641540527;-9.996898651123047;1;So I am a bit of a magpie. So I collect lots of things and I also work with different technologies. So both like I do a little bit of CGI, sometimes. I made sculptures and I perform, and I made some genetics recently, more and more wearable, sort of wearable things that also make sounds. But I'm just sort of like moving in between these things. I'm not good at any of these things. But I'm just sort of like, I don't know, like, picking up on things that I think are relevant to the project more in this way. And in terms of this project that we are, we are beginning now, I think, because one of the things that I am looking at is sort of at some point, I had this idea about creating like, online environments, which would represent something that maybe is like a Holly Well, or like a shrine, or like all these references from I'm talking about Eastern European cultures, but also like sort of British Holly Wells and this sort of, like, old sort of ideas of collecting objects and bringing objects to places and intentions and various different, like, semi spiritual vibes. And I sort of wanted to assemble into something where people can bring all these different assets, which can be words or sounds or objects, and to place them somewhere, online somewhat, and to share them and interact with each other. And, somehow when I heard about this project, I thought that it could potentially somehow connect to these ideas that I have, I guess, um, yeah. I don't know if I want to say anything else. Yes.
7.769623756408691;10.7464017868042;1;And then, Natalia will be leading, also one of the sessions.
16.19532585144043;10.620781898498535;1;Yes. Later, later in the year,
-12.273155212402344;-8.4666166305542;1;From the garden? Yes. Oh, yes. Also, I live in a housing co-op. And I am a pond officer, which means I'm looking after the ponds, which means many things. But yeah, but so I think I will like to sort of maybe during this, I will load into the, I guess, the ecosystem, and different infrastructures that we have in place in the co op and the, I guess the relationship between, I don't know, us and environment and humans and hybrid species. And said that, so this, this is another thing that I'm interested in, both in my practice and maybe just my lived experience of living in a particular infrastructure at the moment.
8.911299705505371;12.368341445922852;1;I'm looking forward to meet you physically at one point, the feeling. So I think we will move now. Thank you so much, Natalia. I think it's right, Rachel is the next on the grid.
-5.348657131195068;13.0264310836792;1;I apologise for cutting in and out a bit. 
-9.164582252502441;-10.98453426361084;1;Yeah, my name is Rachel. I'm Canadian, spent a bit of time in Los Angeles and ended up moving to London. I guess in terms of my practice, it kind of runs the gamut from like very sort of process based sculptures. It's a bit of amateur archaeology. So a little bit of performance lectures, and I've also worked a bit in art and tech. A lot of that was through a collaboration with another artist named Sarah Derat called Digital&Dead so we did some augmented reality like an augmented reality sculpture and a very kind of simple thought. That whole project was, you know, looking at digital afterlife and how we know how our social media zombified social media presence is lived on and continues to sort of have its own afterlife outside of us. I guess in terms of, of my personal work, I think in a lot of ways, I'm primarily interested in how data is sort of organised taxonomies put in categories and sorted but, you know, some interesting like, the politics of like, you know, why, why certain, you know, say certain historic narratives get written in particular ways. How, you know, history is constructed. You know, why certain things are put under one category or another. I think in a lot of ways, you know realising during the pandemic that a big part of the way that I think the way I collect things and organise ideas is influenced by not being neurotypical by having a brain that isn't entirely neurotypical. So that's been something I've been thinking about a lot lately. And I think in terms of this project, one of the things I'm potentially interested in is figuring out a way to use wiki systems to create co-writing projects. So, you know, potentially potentially using, like, a structure like Wikipedia, to, you know, potentially using that kind of structure to allow various authors to write kind of across and in between other people's writing. I'm sorry, I'm, like, totally spaced out. So if this makes any sense, but uh, yeah. Cool. Thank you. 
10.430670738220215;12.766639709472656;1;Thank you, there will be something about collective writing and writing with machines that we wanted to investigate. So interesting to hear this right, Rachel, thank you so much. I think we can move to be the last piece. 
-7.7594757080078125;-14.30748176574707;1;Hi, everyone. Thank you, for all, nice hearing, it was really nice to hear about everyone's practice. So I kind of like my practice lies between research and making. I guess, I've kind of started also while COVID started to reflect Okay, what am I doing? How do I want this to move forward? And then I started to dive into the academic world of research. So I started to write a PhD proposal on the specificity of dating apps and how we can submit a dating app. And then now I moved on to write a new PhD proposal in the art department, this time on cyber feminism. And like looking at different manifestos that were written in recent years. So the Xeno feminist manifesto and glitch feminism are so London based, actually Goldsmiths based. And so I'm kind of looking at how performance online can subvert the image of what we have offered online. So I also have this interest in my practice. And I try to submit things by doing performances online with friends. And I look at all that care as well. I think that's a big, big topic. And recently, I've started to really explore this idea of technology and accessibility again, which I think resonates with lots of people here. So this idea of how, so my dad is going blind. And so we've looked at different technology on what we call emancipation to enhance his seeing, and we've tried lots of new technologies that are based on reality and virtual reality, which of course, did not work. So then we started to kind of question what are those uses of technology and trying to normalise bodies that are disabled and how we can Yeah, how technology does that and promote that similar to like the way social media kind of operates. So I'm currently making a film, which is a short film that has been supported financially by the programme I'm in at the moment. And I'm looking exactly at that idea of what this technology for blind people offers and how we can think of technology in a different way. So I'm trying to propose a less cognitive way of thinking of technology, but a more sensible approach to it. So then I kind of did a performance where I invited lots of people to wear those glasses. I made myself and their glasses that are blurring the vision a bit. And so yeah, so you've probably seen the film and you'll see the reaction of the performance, but that's what I'm kind of exploring and I'm also lucky enough to teach quite a lot. And I'm also doing all of this with the young students so trying to use social media platforms in different ways and which is really interesting, of course to work with the younger audience. And therefore this I think we've met for this workshop, but I'm quite familiar with a few of you in the group. I think Sara, Natalia also I know do very well. And I think maybe Rachel, I was listening to you. I think we have met through was it for them? Yeah, I think it was with some maybe you did a show there. Right. In? Must know, we haven't seen, it was it was it was. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Nice. Yeah.
-1.7567583322525024;-2.370966911315918;1;It's nice. We have a common interest. Yep. And yes, project, I think we've been speaking about, of course workshops, but also, I have an interest in also looking at net art and what net art used to do in the beginning of the internet and how it has this promise of being something then what internet is now. So I've always been keen on developing a website that fully has this finger, you could go through different pages and things will unfold, similar to what Net Art was doing in the early 90s. And yeah, so that's, I think, what we've been discussing a bit like this, this idea of penetrating your website, and maybe see betting through, I don't know how to code, which is a shame, but I would love to, and then trying to find other scripts somehow for for this website, or platform. Cool, thank you. 
-6.307209491729736;-0.39088329672813416;1;It's interesting because I think it was after the first zoom chat we had like, I don't know, when was that like, half a year ago or more? And I remember we were talking about your work with students and also, these avatars. And also, you mentioned, glitch feminism was just something that like, at that point, was kind of coming to me at different points, but I still haven't read it. But then I actually was like, Okay, I'm going to read it. And I have read it since. And it would be amazing to also maybe, yeah, definitely delve into that. Things. So many things. Yeah. And it feels like everyone should read it. It's quite easy to read as well. So it's definitely a great book to unpack. Yeah.
-1.6656583547592163;5.314786434173584;1;And I think relevant to people, even in this group from so many different points of reference.
1.6026997566223145;21.227764129638672;1;Yes, I think maybe I'll mention another book.
-11.000505447387695;-4.205423831939697;1;I can talk a little bit about the origins of the name, the title just happened to be it on its own. And the whole story goes back to last summer when I bumped into Ada at Iklectik in South London, there was a book fair and Ada suggested buying this book called Pharmaco AI. I don't know if you've heard about this book written by Kendric Allado McDowell. It's a book written jointly by the artist and also AI a kind of language generating model called GPT 3. You can see different fonts in the book. So one font is for the human, human voice. And the other font designates the digitally constructed human-like language. And there is one, one chapter that talks about what hyperspace is, it's this different dimension that we can get into through art. It's also about the space in which we perceive the world in a non normative way, I would say. And it just happened to be the title but we've been reflecting on what could the outcomes of our peer groups be because we would like after each of the sessions to upload some traces online onto this new platform in becoming to be able to share with what's happening here in between us in this closed safe space to share it with wider audiences for for the platform visitors to also be able to have some kind of response and some kind of input to what we do, what could shape our future meetings, and we thought that it would be nice to also work with with the machine with the mechanic model to create some kind of a trace. So the idea is to transcribe the sound recording after our sessions and feed it into the Open AI model. And wait to receive a reply from the computer generated voice. So it will be a computer generated text, there will be kind of one voice combining all of our voices together. It's it's also a process through which we want to explore and to question what agency means what ownership means.
-6.895331382751465;-1.6950398683547974;1;Yeah, ownership of our different ideas in this. I mean, there have been discussions about this for a while now, where different ideas come from and like, when they're always informed by all these conversations, we have the books that we read and everything and so I guess this is maybe like an experiment in manifesting it somehow. So like, the voice becomes the voice of, of everybody. Like it's, it's one organism, essentially. And also, we also in the process, I think lose a bit of agency over like the actual processing of the material, which is also something that is going to be an interesting thing to see, I guess, this element of unpredictability, and artificial creativity, that is quite a big topic to explore. 
2.651498556137085;-4.3981733322143555;1;Yeah, it's a, it's an experiment, and we'll see how it goes. But we were just really thinking about the best way to incorporate these traces after every session, somehow, but in a way that maybe would not be too direct and not too controlled by us. And like, lose this kind of idea of, of curating. Which also leads us to another point that we feel a bit strange in this setup, because so far all our projects were very curatorial in a sense, even if they were not exactly like institutional exhibitions. So we were like choosing a group of people telling everyone what to do. The outcomes were kind of preconceived. And so this is the first time that we're just, we're just here, participating like everyone else. Yes, that's why that's why we are organising these peer groups for security, horizontality.
-1.5024127960205078;-10.63526439666748;1;Yeah. And also I work with Agata and this curatorial platform, but I'm also an artist, so I will be also doing my research and like making work and yeah, so it's like different, I guess engaged on different levels. So we it's, it's also our question, our question to you to think of say, after every session, what, what was left with you what kind of format would fit to be left on the platform? And so after, after each of the three groups, we will take care of an upload, and create some kind of an interaction with a wider audience, and to  have it treated as a collective research. As I immediately put a few words about the process of making the platform. Yeah. Erik, would you would you like to share a really basic, basic plan, how, how the platform is being constructed, what it will be at the beginning and how we will move into the actual space, because we're thinking of launching the, the space in less than two weeks and at the beginning it will be, it will be a skeleton of of what it will become in December. But we want we want to treat it as a process.
7.1722211837768555;17.432621002197266;1;So it will be a gradual, gradual birth. This phase. I see yes, maybe Erik would like to tell us a few words, what the idea is for the prototype version?
-5.026132583618164;-10.644618034362793;1;Hey, so Well, first I have to say, I've really enjoyed listening to everyone's introductions, and I'm already super inspired. I've had loads of ideas for the platform, how we can kind of fuse, fuse people's works and ways of working on to the platform. Can you actually hear me by the way? Cool. So, yeah, I'm not really sure what you'd like me to say about the construction. But it's basically at the moment, it's just a skeleton. I've been, I've been looking at first I, I've basically made sure that the that the kind of like the web servers running, and everything's working, and I've been building the back end, and the way that I like to build websites is that I make them into kind of like web apps. So that involves writing like an algorithmic system basically to, to, to basically, dynamically create the content from the data instead of having to kind of like manually inserting every upload into the, into the code. So I guess, I guess what I'm thinking initially is something like, a fairly kind of, basically like a I'm not really sure I'm able to verbalise it at the moment. What I'm trying to say. So it's probably the thought is not ready, ready to come out.
9.025346755981445;2.7796335220336914;1;I think it's really, I mean, it's really early. But as we are here all together, you want at this point to have any questions or thoughts, but as I say, like, it's fine. It's really thank the first meeting, if anyone wants to ask anything to add or to Erik, then yeah, maybe that's, that's better?
-15.804503440856934;4.219747066497803;1;Yes, we I think we should also mention that as, as it's the first project that we really seriously work with technology. It's also about questioning it. It's about questioning its limits. Its really understanding what it contains where they were within itself. I don't know what the discussion is.
8.245757102966309;0.8116135001182556;1;I have a quick question to Erik have I really should in relation to the web design, not design the website building? Like, would it be like in relation to what Agata was saying, how this audio recording gonna be put into open and then I'm not really sure it's really out of my I'm just like, thinking possibilities might not be practical. Like that. What the odds of that being put into the eye, will that play a part in this into building the website? Without taking the role? That what? You're okay. Yeah. Yeah. 
-10.1028470993042;-5.876459121704102;1;So basically, First, I need to clarify that what I think what Agata was talking about was that the audio would be first transcribed into text, and then the text would be text that would be fed into the model. And that's, I mean, the idea is, isn't necessarily to use Open AI as GPT 3, but something similar If not that so a language model of of generating something something generative where we have some kinds of materials, responses from these workshops, in whatever media, they they kind of take form, and then use some kind of kind of generative model to, to kind of respond to, to our thoughts, I guess. But the way that it would play a role in constructing the website is that I kind of, I want to as we're building it throughout the year, I think even though I'd like to have quite a kind of set structure in place of how things and like, elements on the website are going to be, I'd still like to kind of devise the website, using the materials as we go along, as opposed to kind of designing it now and then just adding some materials. So if I'm not sure if that answers your question, or if I'm not sure if I interrupted your question,
-5.987240314483643;-6.194272994995117;1;Whatsoever, I'm just thinking, I only recently got to know that idea of DAU decentralised, autonomous organisation, that's what when I was thinking about this group, I was in that idea of DAU of how can we create this decentralised, autonomous organisation? From what I know of DAU that they use this kind of voting system? So I was thinking, how are we gonna interact with this thing of, like, what could we produce work that we want? And it's quite subjective. And when put into AI collectively, I wonder how do we access to be able to interact with what comes out of that input?
8.762153625488281;-13.794477462768555;1;Yeah, I think that's a good thing to think about.
3.6709420680999756;-22.21841049194336;1;Is it about responding to the output we get from any, any kind of model? Other Yeah.
-1.0550239086151123;-7.819036960601807;1;Yeah, I think I will say maybe like, example, the, if we were to give like a paradigm like periphery to AI say that we want to see more busy images and then more busy images, but then what that paradigm prefers is set what? So how do we create something that is not necessarily I mean, it will be interesting what we want collectively, but also if there's possible possibility of creating something of value or not with it's not how to say no, it's not necessarily what we want, like a specific thing we want, like without a limit of what we want
17.006389617919922;-3.7887399196624756;1;I understand what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. And it sounds interesting.
3.574089765548706;-23.0267391204834;1;Is it about training training the model to get
7.391303062438965;-17.344093322753906;1;I think it's more about kind of directing, restricting No.
7.810665130615234;-16.612327575683594;1;Yeah, I think. So I'm kind of taking the whole house sideways
1.0699734687805176;0.6649813652038574;1;kind of working with the machine to achieve a joint outcome? did. Did we also have some kind of control? Yeah. So random? Yes. Yeah. This is,
-10.405274391174316;1.221159815788269;1;like certain, because it's interacting with us a certain sense of like asking in it, but it's not made by us. Make something it is like an environment like the planet planet, that is not the planet Earth, we're living in a generally in a way  to influence what is becoming where we put it, the input we have of like, as per making work, that actually this was machine or artificial intelligence, will that like, automatically generate something without, that is not produced by us. But then we're feeding in information so that maybe something else could become self sufficient? Huh.
-11.795672416687012;-3.1325080394744873;1;This is interesting what you mentioned, because for example, even though the book that I mentioned, was written by, by this artificial model, anything that was produced by it was still edited by the human. So it's, it's, it's in a relationship that goes both ways. I don't know if this is something that you're thinking of that we feed in things, we get outcomes, but then still, we can work with them further. 
-0.9350206255912781;-9.073626518249512;1;For it is also seen, it's also evolving, because the more time we spend with it, the more we feed it, the more it has these parameters that you were talking about, I guess, like the walls are slowly being kind of like from a sketch. But then like, this is the question, like, do we, like want this? Like, what are these walls? I guess it's also like another thing, which is in the back of the project, and how we are trying, we still trying to figure this out, what we want to achieve somehow, at least at some point, is the interaction from the outside so from the audience, and actually create a kind of tool for the audience to interact with the material to feed back into the platform that we can then take and maybe take to another session. So it becomes like, not a very close circle of us just thinking and doing things but it kind of comes out and then an out and then. So maybe then if that actually happens, and we actually succeed in creating this interaction with the audience, maybe other voices can start to be fed into this thing, and then broaden the kind of universe that is built from us. But then maybe, yeah,
-13.023754119873047;10.86336612701416;1;I guess we can also mention, another idea that we had is to create platforms own voice for
-2.3965229988098145;3.888021945953369;1;levelling a lot of different names
-5.756892204284668;-4.901235103607178;1;and leaders, but I think it's good just to throw them into space and, and I hope we will also have input from you to kind of mould these ideas into one. One organism that will live on this platform. If we have visual material, there will always be audio, audio part of it for anyone to be able to access, access your work there. So we're thinking of maybe also creating some kind of distinct voice that would be part of this space, or that would be this organism that this creation will become. But as Erik says, it's really early in the process, we still don't have the proper skeleton we are gathering material to be ready to publish the first version in in a couple of weeks. And I guess, from then, after our first, after the first peer group, I think we'll know better what, what the potential is.
-15.625123977661133;-3.3373022079467773;1;Can I just have one question to what you said? Like, because I don't know if I understood that, right, at some point when you said about, like, how what we feed can actually impact the build of the website itself? Did you mean that like, this has been somehow incorporated into the coding of the website, and this way, like this affects the environment? Or did I just like made this up? I don't know if I, I don't think I explained it very well. But
-3.684169054031372;-8.582770347595215;1;I think I kind of understand if I understand right is or understand myself, like I was, I was like, basically thinking about the example of the planned toy, the link that was put in the chat. So they create this like plan to this flower by fading into like, crypto block. So it's, it's, it's written on blockchain and by fading the, this plantoids the plan to it eventually will be to have Library's own and then generate, like commission other people or machines to make it work. So I guess it's a kind of list of what we talk about that becomes part of the coding process.
2.5318968296051025;23.846338272094727;1;If you mean something like permaculture, perma permaculture,
4.098331928253174;12.621929168701172;1;of the virtual, I think,
2.1534743309020996;22.83831024169922;1;yes, I think permaculture literally just you have a raised hand
-7.124136447906494;-7.624485492706299;1;I wasn't gonna stick. But, um, maybe it's relevant to that topic. But I was just thinking I've never worked directly with AI but I'd be interested to see in the sense of maybe one out of you asking how it will relate to our conversations and kind of peer community making. But I think as we go along, we're already influencing each other as to what we put on the table and share and with that being given, also, I don't know how the AI would be programmed to generate new material but then have a life of its own. But I think it'd be interesting to have that like extra entity to then also collaborate with us in the sense of what it gives back to us as this kind of other brain that kind of brainstorms all of us together and then generate new ideas from us of what could be this kind of becoming because bring forward things that we wouldn't altogether maybe you know, together revise in this way so exactly something that we were thinking about of this one thing being multiple voices that we have here you know, bringing one bird what bird containing everybody in this one body this one voice that would be the output
-3.890463352203369;19.913555145263672;1;Shall we do some practicals? 
4.192727088928223;3.838228702545166;1;Yes. And also we were thinking of ways of making the whole project public and if you have any specific ideas or preferences of media channels you use and what works for you online and what does not it would be really helpful for us to take into consideration throughout the whole process I guess this is for the beginning. So we can maybe share the screen of the project plan.
4.446751117706299;-8.894194602966309;1;Oh, yeah. I need to find it. It's here Yes. This is so at the end that we just wanted to ask you about practical things like the dates and just to confirm with everyone this is a very, like, as you can see, everything is to be confirmed. So these dates They're not set in stone. But basically as long as we are all together we wanted to ask if Fridays work for everyone, or if we should think of another day. And then this is like roughly the plan for all the sessions, which might kind of shift around and we might change specific dates. I know that it is around June or May, anyway, it doesn't matter. Just roughly kind of roughly, we wanted to ask, which days work for everyone whether we should? Yeah, basically, shall we stay with Friday, but maybe do it a little bit later? Like that six or later? We do have some other days. So the month I don't know. If anyone can't do Fridays, maybe then speak.
14.02853012084961;1.7675496339797974;1;I was just looking. So the live event you're planning on near Christmas, right? Yeah. Is that the final date? It seems to be confirmed. But no, it's now mid mid December.
1.0577564239501953;-10.02113151550293;1;But yeah, we thought about this. It is kind of like when we are planning the project, because this is just a version for you. But the whole project has all these other things that have to come in place as well. And it took us to mid December. However, I mean, we're flexible with that. And if it turns out that it's not working for us as well, we can. I guess we can shift things around. But in terms of like for all the sessions to happen, and to have this kind of like a little bit of break over the summer. We also allocated time for everyone individually to maybe contact Erik, if there's specific questions regarding works and like how the works are gonna be put on the platform and stuff like that. That took us to December which Yeah, I mean that we were not extremely happy that it was close to Christmas. But actually, maybe.
7.020294189453125;-1.9470062255859375;1;I was just asking, I guess, because I'm not in London. So I need to book a flight at some point. I'm not sure if I'm in London, but yeah. All right.
10.536566734313965;-4.287207126617432;1;I mean, we can speak about this further on. Once we also confirm the venue, which should be in the next few months. I think by the summer, probably we should have concrete. Okay. But yeah, anyways, like in terms of the Friday meetings, is that, is that something that works for everyone? I'll stop now.
10.310384750366211;-7.5785064697265625;1;I mean, things are out there online.
-6.68096923828125;5.827728271484375;1;Okay, so this one won't be. And I think and I think potentially, what did we say as well, I just wanted to say that even though we have final events in space, and it will be an amazing opportunity for us to get together face to face, because we work with technology, we we hope this can this can this will enable us to be to be present with everyone that cannot make it to then. So we will try to find ways for anyone that is not able to travel or is not able to be in the same place as we are to still to be able to participate in a non embodied way.
-7.637235164642334;5.369285583496094;1;Yeah, like there isn't going to be anything that is going to be exclusive. We don't expect everyone to be able, even though it would be great, we will try to find ways for it to also work at a distance.
5.85195779800415;-4.595661163330078;1;That was what I was thinking in terms of workshop in the garden. I mean, we can easily livestream it. Yeah, that's not a problem at all. So especially these days, we plan the next we expect anyone to know and I mean, it's just we will. I think we will talk about this one in particular, which you Natalia  how you envisaged it in the best way. We just thought that maybe it would be nice to come together for the people that are in London. Having said that, they'll definitely have the kind of zoom aspect of it.
-0.24568964540958405;14.84706974029541;1;To be away and stupid. dissipate.
6.065227508544922;-2.747901678085327;1;And I feel like it's not really fair. No. Saying like for people who are in London together, but yeah, we'll see. Most of it though, like 80% of them is supposed to be zoom based.
8.488696098327637;-12.271053314208984;1;I think would be would be good to share with you these tentative plan with the dates and maybe all of you could respond if if they seem fine
0.19158336520195007;12.873583793640137;1;as well if they're more like afternoon or evenings, are they always similar times or?
10.79076099395752;-1.4805163145065308;1;And this one was specifically pushed earlier, but we were thinking of maybe evening. Yeah, like 6pm, I think
10.379423141479492;-2.3196628093719482;1;6pm. Just to make sure that even if people have things on on a Friday, like, Yeah,
7.895436763763428;-10.912827491760254;1;but we we can share these specific dates, these specific Fridays, and maybe you could reply to us if this Friday evening is fine. And it will try to work around everyone's schedule.
-8.154207229614258;15.894914627075195;1;I know some some people because Sara, you are an hour ahead or two. It was Erik
-8.6503324508667;16.636335372924805;1;Now, France, the same? Price is the same? Or one hour after an hour? Yeah, at least one hour.
8.703924179077148;-8.32275676727295;1;I was just saying that, like, around this time is fine. But if it's later than I mean, I mean, it's only a few Fridays. So I mean, it's fine. As long as I know the dates, I'm flexible.
11.177414894104004;5.873805046081543;1;the dates with us. But it was really nice to hear you all today. Wrapping up to also see everyone in one space. I think so unless you want to add anything. So we are thinking of the next meeting, just this month to be still the same month. So we hope we'll be able to gather at the end of March for a workshop with Lea. But we will share more information about this with you soon. And I guess maybe we should leave it here and just wait for all the ideas and questions to come up. And please do share whatever, whatever comes to your mind.
-5.33339786529541;6.056086540222168;1;I just wanted to say that that Lea and myself, we are just finishing our peer forum in Camden Arts Centre. And on the 12th and 13th we have some events that are also on subject of care, which became sort of the main event theme. So if you are around in London, please do come there will be workshops and various different activities we're going to run and, and speak about stuff and yeah.
6.386837482452393;-5.978476047515869;1;Yeah. Can I just quickly say one thing as well? Yeah, this I was just wondering if it would be possible to kind of organise ourselves into some kind of social space somewhere. Just so that I mean, I mean, cuz I mean, I don't have anyone's email or anything, but even better than just having everyone's email addresses. It might be good to have a shared slack or Discord server or, or something where we can, like talking. That's around, right. Is Discord or Whatsapp group? Would it? What are your preferences? Say this, 
14.988204002380371;9.530220985412598;1;I used Discord before. Yes, we could.
1.4772355556488037;18.102956771850586;1;Either one. We'll set something up.
11.456817626953125;15.672791481018066;1;Okay. Cool. Mm hmm. Maybe you could also think of something like this for the platform itself. Maybe it just could be connected. Okay, Well have nice evenings. Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you for sharing your professional personal stories. And we'll be in touch with you soon with more updates and hopefully see you still this month in a little bit different format. Thank you. 
-17.58892822265625;-1.6616417169570923;2;It's too big. Maybe too obvious. I don't know how to describe it.
