First, we will draw on previous literature to discuss the organizational and technological processes through which microwork platforms produce placelessness and dispersal. We argue that we must also understand what impacts these processes have on identity formation in order to understand their full implications to collective action. We will then introduce the empirical study, consisting mainly of participant observation and interviews of 30 microworkers. We first use the empirical study to examine microwork in everyday life and its consequences to organizational identity. We will then use the study to examine attempts to counter dispersal and reunite microworkers, both on the material level of bringing dispersed workers together in ‘virtual places’, as well as on the ideological level of developing occupational and class identities. In the final section, we will discuss the main findings in the context of some earlier work on service value chain restructuring and freelance knowledge workers, highlighting theoretical and policy implications.
