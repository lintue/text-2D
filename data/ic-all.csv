-15.806779861450195;0.7568387985229492;0;Thanks for coming together in this very special way that we've just talked about the fact that it's still a little bit strange for us to meet you through the screen, and that we are still  learning these new ways of gathering people together. 
3.96909499168396;3.4319183826446533;0;I think it would be nice to talk a little bit about us and about Irruptive Chora, because I think with some of you we have worked in the past, but not everyone I think is familiar. So just to keep it short. We were laughing today, because I got asked that maybe I should tell this story. At some point, when we were running a radio show, this story got recounted so many times. But now I realise that I actually I think I haven't told it for like three years. So there is the story we met during, we didn't really meet, we knew each other. But we met again, after sometime, as it happens, when we have these, like, meetings. Knowing each other, then something happens during a reading group in the ICA. And that was after I graduated from the RCA and Agata was in her final year and just graduated, we were in this reading group. And I think the subjects we kind of touched upon during the group really resonated with us. And we thought that it would be nice to do something together. And maybe it started with an idea to maybe run a reading group and continue this conversation in our own time and facilitate these meetings with other people. And then this grew into something much bigger, a project that has been running for like, three years now. And the reading group never happened. But we did start with five performative events. And then from then on, we did different like radio broadcasts, exhibitions and performances.
-12.932648658752441;12.717598915100098;0;I think it's important to say that we started with an idea of a reading group, because we were thinking about language, in itself, trying to think of ways of expanding limits of language. And I think it's important to say it now, because our collaboration started with a text and also during this project, we will be kind of playing around with spoken language,  transcribing language and also with artificially produced language by machines, digitally constructed human language. So there is a thread of communication, yes, I mean, indicating through language, but also finding new ways of communicating with not only human beings. 
1.5062510967254639;16.96288299560547;0;Which I think leads to this other thing, initially, all the things that we've been doing, were very much about gathering together physically, everything came from the actual thematics that started with thinking about coming back to the body and like the embodiment of different states, and just generally working a lot with the body and then slowly kind of moving towards a lot of sonic work and, and then we found ourselves in the pandemic. And I think that was kind of like a catalyst to push further these explorations, how can we still keep working and find other ways of working with people. And what could that be? And the process was quite long, because like, now we're, it's been two years, right, since the beginning of the pandemic exactly to me, but the project has been growing for a year now. I think it's going to be something else now than what we thought it would have been a year ago. 
-14.528672218322754;8.208333969116211;0;But that's also nice, we do come back, we move away from the idea and we come back again, I think this this cycling and nonlinear way of thinking about time that is  also related to our last project that we organised just before pandemic and some of you took part in it was called recovery. It was a project that was also very much focused on exploring totally process based activity. So It was a three weeks long residency and evolving exhibition that explored the theme of recovery. And also thought about its process and the fact that it's never, never a closed set cycle. It's never a circle, it's, it's going backwards that happens when we move into the future. And  I'm mentioning it now, because layering and non linearity will be a big part of the virtual space that we want to create between us. And also, the whole project that we invite you to, is about, it's about process. It's a research research project with no predefined outcomes, predefined ideas, but of getting together as its core purpose of thinking, making, sharing. And learning from each other as its main focus.
-15.314594268798828;7.591827869415283;0;We're talking a lot about ourselves. But that actually brings us to the point that the main aim was just to bring people together, and maybe and engage in a project that would be more long term that would allow us to come back to these relationships that we're building for a project, unlike in the past, where it was very encounter-based, but but kind of, we felt that there was a continuity lacking. And that's what we wanted to achieve, maybe or try to achieve with this project.
-18.344560623168945;9.974908828735352;0;And also we never were based in any one specific place. We were a nomadic platform. So we always moved between institutions and different physical spaces. And we thought that the digital space would grant us some kind of sustainability.
-23.47807502746582;4.40881872177124;0;Yeah. And autonomy as well.
23.317955017089844;-8.719069480895996;0;Independence. Yeah.
13.251996994018555;9.146749496459961;0;But I think, shall we ask maybe. So basically, I think this session, like we just wanted to hear about what you've been doing and thinking and making recently and like, how could you imagine participating in this project? What is there that you would specifically maybe want to think about or like, get from it, just just kind of like loose faults, really. And also to get to know each other? Because we know most of you. But I don't think everyone knows each other.
-17.785085678100586;8.6314697265625;0;So I remember that we shared some themes that we wanted to cover during the peer group sessions. But we would like to hear any ideas that you are occupied with, because this is a collective creation. And as there's no final preconceived outcome, we want this process to be shaped as we go on. 
-17.606691360473633;7.137905120849609;0;So it would be great just to hear from you because some of you, I think, we started the conversation more than half a year ago. So maybe things changed as well. And where you're at now and what you're doing.
-20.080854415893555;7.090145587921143;0;Exactly where are you? What are you working with? What are your anxieties? What are your ambitions? Would anyone like to start?
7.052309036254883;-20.432153701782227;0;Maybe? awkwardly, but we were thinking how to avoid this, but then. But then it would be, it just would be really nice to hear from all of you and hear everyone's voice.
-25.615381240844727;-5.166744232177734;0;Okay, so maybe Erik wants to start, but I think we are maybe, yep. Erik is gonna say on his own, about his role in the project. Cool. Yeah. Thanks. Thank you for volunteering. 
18.795549392700195;13.917600631713867;0;Hey, can you hear me and see me? Yep. Cool. So I'm Erik. I'm working on this project as I'm building the digital platform. So if you have any, if you have any ideas or questions about that, at Any point, just let me know. So I thought I'd just tell you where I'm at, what I'm doing, what I've been doing. And yeah, I've been a bit busy this week. So I'm just a bit out of it. So sorry about that. I'm trying to share my screen. Can you see my screen? Yes. Cool. Okay, so at the moment, I'm working. I'm in Helsinki. I studied at the RCA. I graduated in, I think it was 2021 or 2020. And now I'm in Helsinki, and I am working this year as a research assistant at the Finnish Centre for artificial intelligence. Some AI research. And I come from a background in. In sound art, I've been working in radio, theatre, and live music. And then from there, I kind of got really interested in working with data, so data sonification data visualisation. And that's how I ended up at the RCA. I studied a course called information experience design. So I'm really interested in how we, how we, how we can kind of work with information, how we represent information, how we experience information. And so that's, that's sort of how I got interested in AI. And so if you see my screen here, and basically like one of the one of the kind of overarching themes and in, in my own work, and in my thinking, is representation representations, so I'm quite interested in how we how we can represent information, whether it's visual, auditory or whether it's language and mostly in, in the context of like AI how we can, how we can kind of how we can represent these, like physical phenomena digitally, so what, what kind of emerges from that system of spearing these digital representations of things into this like weird mathematical, statistical computational system. And then, I'm very interested in how we can kind of come up with systems and interfaces to interpret those systems. So I think the field is known as interpretable machine learning or interpretable AI. So, I'm interested in all kinds of data, visualisations feature visualisations. And as yeah, there's some really cool work being done at the moment with neural nets. For instance, this image here is a generative neural nets. That's been trained on a data set of somebody playing GTA 5. And it's really interesting where in the system, how it works is basically you're controlling you're using a controller to move just move forwards, left, right or backwards, or whatever, I think they might be using a joystick. And then the, the network predicts the imagery that kind of happens based on the based on the movement of the joystick, and what's really interesting here to me is that you're actually not inside a game engine like you would be so basically you'd use if you would be playing a game you'd be in this like 3d game engine. And when you move when you make the movement on your controller it would be rendered into an image. Whereas like this is a neural net that's kind of learned a representation of the physics engine that would be used in the. So it's basically like, a neural net has just learned basically, it's like a game engine. And it's really weird. And it would be interesting to know how it kind of works. So, I mean, these are the kinds of things I'm quite intrigued by generally. But yeah, mostly I work with things like data visualisations and, and thinking about interfaces for interfacing with information in these machine learning systems. And, yeah, that's pretty much it. So from this project, I just want to experiment with the platform. So different ways of interfacing with information and, and seeing what comes out. And I'm kind of treating it as my own artistic contribution to the project. So we're going to be publishing it as this very plain, empty-ish kind of site, and then just kind of shaping it as we move along with these peer group sessions, and the project in general, so. So yeah, looking forward to meeting you all, and yet, sorry that I'm just completely out of it. Tonight. I'm sure we'll have lots of opportunities to get to know each other better.
-26.18944549560547;10.41161060333252;0;And there's a question, Erik, how is this neural network called?
-0.011726165190339088;6.609521389007568;0;So basically, this is a general generative adversarial network again, I don't actually know much about it, because it's not a project that I've worked on. But it's just something that I've seen recently. That's like, super interesting. And they've called it just Gun Theft Auto instead of Grand Theft Auto. So I think you'll be able to find some information on it based on that, but it's but it's again, that's like that's what they're using, but it's and I can actually just write in Yeah. Don't let somebody else introduce themselves. And if you have any more questions, just let me know. Thank you.
-25.764524459838867;-5.093109130859375;0;Anyone else wants to continue? Okay, shall we go by our screen? Yes. Do do we introduce how we know each other maybe?
-17.732847213745117;1.748462200164795;0;Okay, we can like ease in. So the first person on our grid is Sara. So we were talking quite a bit recently, because we've just recorded a broadcast with Sara. And Sara was also part of the our last pre pandemic project Recovery she performed. 
-16.140501022338867;9.985127449035645;0;So would you like to say a few words about your current project Landra because we will be also leading a workshop that is related to your new life, your practice there, and maybe it would be interesting to hear how you are doing and what is it? What is it about?
-17.0022029876709;8.569859504699707;0;I mean, for us, it was one of the reasons to bring you to this particular project because it's like, an actual embodiment of the idea of searching for new ways of existing, basically. So it's really exciting to hear about it.
18.21295928955078;17.610139846801758;0;Sure. Yes. Thank you for inviting me in. Hi, everyone. Um, can you hear this noise or is it just annoying me? It's good. So I'm just like a kind of brief introduction. I'm from Portugal, but I lived in London for more than 10 years. Graduated from a MFA at Goldsmiths. Although I've studied music before, as well, so I'm kind of in the interdisciplinary group, as probably most of you also are, it's kind of in between zones. I worked a lot on researching how we humans relate to kind of macro systems, but also microsystems relating to our own environments, and how these environments also have repercussions around the world and how all this kind of connectivity pans out and in contemporary society. And maybe I could share my screen as well. I'll share my screen. Yes. And so I guess, when I was in London, I was looking a lot more into these kinds of macro systems because of how London is connected and how our way of life is ultimately shaped by all these kinds of global connections of trade, and, and products and services. And so I was looking a lot more into global systems. This is called ‘Degrees of Abstraction’. And so I start with these kinds of graphs that then open up into actual soil, and I was researching things such as pesticides, herbicides, land deals, and kind of this unravelling of processes. Yeah, um, and so but since I kind of came back to Portugal, I came back, kind of in the beginning of the pandemic, but not necessarily because of the pandemic. So the idea was really, because I was kind of delving into all these ecological questions. We, me and my partner really felt the need to kind of go closer to the land and really work with the land, something we didn't think was possible much in London, we did have like a tiny allotment, which was where things kind of started having a more material grasp for us in terms of having this really relation to for example, how we eat and how we produce our basic sustenance. So the moments on our orchard. Oh, hello. Oh, did you lose me?
-25.021862030029297;13.233033180236816;0;Am I exactly lost, you? Know, digitised robotic voice.
19.255659103393555;17.90254020690918;0;Um, yes, I don't work so much with this kind of advanced technology as some of you. It's funny that this happened. But yeah, so I'm kind of, in a way going the other direction not necessarily against kind of the production of new technologies or science, but really kind of going back to the essence of also what it means to be alive and in relation to our ecosystems that are in this day and age being completely degraded and taken off a kind of a more personal relation of ourselves with the rest of the environments, which were a part of, but there's a lot of alienation taking place. And so we decided to go back and really try to and relate to these processes one on one, and so we're kind of living on enough in this land, which had a stone house, but it's kind of derelict, so we're slowly refurbishing it, um, and it's one kilometre down, it's hard to kind of go there by car. And so we started kind of just camping because we weren't sure the house was really livable. And then we got a wood stove. Then we started getting this kind of tiny solar panel just to charge our phones. And so we've been kind of really living all the stages, with kind of, with a basic relief that we need to survive. And we started recognising we did a lot of foraging practice back in London. And that's why we started because it's a practice in London, maybe more than in Portugal in a lot of ways. And so now we recognise most of the plants that are on the land are actually edible, for example, which a lot of people have now forgotten about. Since the kind of industrialization and the kind of rise of huge supermarket chains and these other systems of production, it's also very associated with poverty, and so a lot of people have forgotten about the kind of edible uses and medicinal uses of these planets. We're also building our own kind of solar system, piece by piece. Yeah, we found these batteries that are non toxic, which are nickel ions when they were initially developed by Edison. And that were not commercialised because they were kind of too big, to be marketable, but they're not non pollutant. And by the end of their life, you can even send the kind of water back to the potatoes, and then kind of make them rechargeable again. So that's quite exciting. And the name Ladra comes from, from the word Landras, which was the word for acorns in the north of Portugal and Galicia. And back in the days, people used to eat acorns. And now it's a forgotten practice. But the exciting thing about Acorns is that they obviously come from trees, from Oak trees, and they're perennials and so you don't need to kind of bring the land back to zero every year with annual cultures or monocultures to kind of get your main nutrients or, yeah. So that was something exciting for us in terms of land sovereignty, and kind of working with complex ecosystems and not having to necessarily destroy these ecosystems to survive. I've also done a permaculture course more recently, and so that kind of really brought forward all these interests in a more practical sense. And so I guess I'll just share it once again. So some of my recent projects have been working really with the Portuguese landscapes and, and territory and use of land and sovereignty. I work a lot with performance as well. I think you can kind of see it, these are the these were all these are kind of representative graphs. But the little sticks are representative of a lot of species that we found that have a lot of users. But normally this type of the landscape that we were working with, is normally transformed into monocultures. Normally it's normally said that they need to not have anything around to be productive, which is not necessarily true. And so these landscapes are very kind of monoculture. Now, because of these practices. You can see that in this kind of image here. It's kind of you know, just started off to trees and bare ground. And the space where I'm speaking of now, which was where I was telling you the beginning, this space, which I'm showing now, which was where we kind of did a garden that just looked like a bare patch of soil. And it was hard work to convince the actual institution to transform the space. I did a microbiology course also recently, so we actually have a microscope and were able to analyse the soil from this land, which was very compacted and dry was basically mineral with no very little kind of soil life and like microscopic life to then a an abandoned a lot nearby, which was a prior garden that had a lot of species thriving and in a whole kind of biodiversity ecosystem. And we tried to bring this species back by first kind of re-inoculating the soil and treating them be able to to have these species come back here so that the first column on the left here shows a very mineral soil and more and more you see the more biodiversity that makes your life in the soil from the analysis of the abandoned garden. And then here's things that we grew. And yeah, we made a video. So I work a lot also with performance. And this is a lecture performance specifically. But yeah, I guess this is the website of Landra. So we talked about sovereignty and, and trying to work through the idea of auto sufficiency as much as we can. And I think we're nearly there trying to really push the limits of how much we can. We can really co-inhabit a land and get what we need from it without having to exploit it, to exploit other other systems of production. And we have a space here with practices. So composting, other methodologies such as, yeah, not tribe and cultural agroforestry systems have a little diary, a calendar of the kind throughout the year, a library of some books and other other things. And I guess I'll leave it at that, because it's a lot of us sorry, I really don't know, when I speak how long I take, there we go. Thank you so much.
-20.217771530151367;9.704571723937988;0;Looking forward, how we can bring all of this land into our virtual space. Be interesting.
-1.1927695274353027;16.041128158569336;0;Activated me with your proposal was how this is all kind of online space, and how to really kind of join these two and make them speak to each other and have us grow together. Because this will be quite some time we spent during these months, it will be interesting to see how this space online and also your land is developing and how your life changed throughout all of these months, and how your interaction is influenced by it. Interesting, thank you so much. Should we move to  the next in our gallery view? So would you like to share any expectations and things that you're working on now?
1.30617094039917;15.916234970092773;0;First of all, thank you very much for inviting me. It's really nice being here and seeing some very familiar faces and also some new ones. So yeah, I am working primarily with images still and moving. But also sound and in situ installations. My research surrounds the notions of silence which also corresponds with the project, I think because I'm quite intrigued by the accessibility aspect of it. And silence as a means of transformation and as a practice of exchanging and setting things. I'm also interested in the notion of trace. And all my research includes elements of vernacular architecture, collective memory and folk tradition. With my work, I'm mainly attempting to highlight the significance of the ephemeral space that surrounds us, physical or material, the processes that save the space and how they affect our relation with the land and other beings badly to all data maintaining a teaching practices Well, in and out of the institutional boundaries, I would say. And I often collaborate with Ramona, who is also in our group, as well as with different people in the process of developing ideas and material for educational activities. So yeah, obviously, I'm excited to work with new people from different disciplines that I haven't had the chance to explore so far in my life. So it's quite interesting. And last but not least, coincidentally, also because I saw it in your themes, my whole teaching practice accidentally in the beginning, but now very like, like deliberately is surrounding a lot of neurodiverse practices like working with people that are coming from this background, so yeah, this is also something that resonates with me a lot. Thanks.
-15.978568077087402;10.192445755004883;0;Thank you so much. It happens that Ramona who you collaborate with is next on our gallery grid. Would you like to say a few words about your practice, your expectations of this project, and maybe any relationship with technology that you have? In your work? 
18.359844207763672;16.181812286376953;0;Yes, thanks for having me. My practice comes kind of mainly work with photography, in a more physical way. A lot of process and kind of working with spaces and in responsive spaces. So themes of nature, such things, I find in the nature, make, inspired by nature, or also the kind of relationship between humans and animals and kind of your intersection with nature as well. Within the practice, also esoteric set as well, and do a lot of teaching and kind of what I want to explore, I think you mentioned in the beginning, as well as the idea of process and I think in photography it doesn't really go well, because it's really hard to work only with process, because often there's always this desire of the outcome, you know, always you take the image just like the final print, and it's kind of in a space, but there's so much more to it. And I think also working really with non narrative as well. So working with the medium or other also use text as well in the work is, how can I translate? Yeah, certain experiences. And I think that's why it will be really interesting, I guess, bringing technology in as well. Because I think actually, I don't really work much with technology and all these things, I'm interested definitely in themes to, you know, the human, the non human. But for me, it's always been such a material way I explored it. So it might be quite challenging and also work very analogue in a way.
21.934642791748047;15.741898536682129;0;I think just, before we move to the next person, I wanted to just expand on what you just said, the fact that your work is very tactile. And just to say that, when we were thinking of all the people, we wanted to invite to the project, the idea was to actually create a quite a diverse group of people who are whose work is very much technology based, or inquiring into different digital technologies, and then have people who are very material base, and see how this can create new dynamics, but also create this exchange between different people in the group translation, and also thinking about translation of how can we actually, this was something that is more connected to the pandemic, and this idea that talking to different people, different artists, friends had very different experiences. And that goes back to the first most the first year of the pandemic, when, when it actually hit everyone. And, there was this feeling that a lot of people just like really, very soon found themselves in these new environments, and were really capable of using them in creative ways. And then there were these other people that didn't really know how, like what to do, like, if my practice is material based, like how do I translate it in a way that's actually engaging and interesting to others. So that's yeah, that was that was also kind of behind the idea for the project to to, to create this horizontal exchange, but also create these this space for people who have very different practices, to to function in this like, hybrid approach that we we kind of want to take.
-18.66097640991211;9.036931991577148;0;I think it's important for us to mention the fact that we always want to remember the digital, it's not a substitute for what we do here. In here. Now in the physical reality, we want to remember that our adventure with technology was about expanding the embodiment, it was something that was really inherent to our bodies. So we want to stay in touch with both the material while still being in the virtual space together. So there will be crossovers.
-24.8416690826416;-1.5806024074554443;0;And this really, like this was very much at the core of how we were thinking about making the group of people. So yeah, thank you, Ramona, and the next person, Tanya
-27.71041488647461;2.791757822036743;0;Hello, can you hear me? Yes, very well
17.556968688964844;17.103450775146484;0;be okay accompanying it from my iPhone. My computer doesn't work with a camera. So yeah, I'm Tanya, I'm in London, originally from rural Wales. I was at college with Ania. So we've known each other for quite a few years. I work predominantly with film photography, installation, as opposed in a kind of broadest sense, I'd say, a kind of look at constructive speculative environments. And the relationship of language that informs and distrusts, disrupts these belief systems, and ownership and belonging within these environments. So that's kind of like a very broad term. But I haven't made work for two years since the pandemic happened, really, because I was working full time. And then my father passed away in the middle of it. And I had this like, urgency to create but I didn't quite know how to create because film isn't very intuitive sometimes. So I started writing, which is kind of relatively new for me. So it's kind of a very new part of my practice, which is quite exciting. And I don't really know where to place it, because it's not my world. But I'd say it's between kind of an essayistic auto fiction. And obviously, from going through loss, it's covering all of these themes of life and death, decay, renewal, reincarnation, and the afterlife. And it also very much touches on care, which is kind of what I was thinking very much about this project and care in the digital and remote, which is what was happening as my father was passing away, and the labour of care, and also interspecies care. So I thought this would kind of, yeah, fit into this. But I do want to start going back to film. So I'm kind of trying to work backwards now from voting to the visual again. So that's where I'm at.
1.2097164392471313;16.246288299560547;0;Thanks. I think that yeah, it's, it's quite interesting that you mentioned care, because that's also something that we, we've really wanted to think about more in lots of different contexts. It's something that also came up and in this radio series that we do kind of parallel to the project. We've been discussing care a lot, not a lot actually, in the limits of like, the one hour it appeared, and it's something that I really want to think about more and I think the project itself has an aim of creating some kind of a support network support structures between us, for us, it will be kind of a base, it's a platform through which we create new friendships, meet others and and this is a kind of technique of care is it will be some kind of care that will go into it. And hopefully, these support structures will be sustained into eternity like the digital is, thank you so much for this sharing. 
-26.33983612060547;8.93050479888916;0;Sorry, this is outside of our control who's coming after another one but it's peer trust.
-29.755990982055664;15.452043533325195;0;It's the artificial intelligence
-13.84873104095459;10.7942533493042;0;I actually saw Pietro’s work last year. And I think I was mostly fascinated by the relationship between the artist as the human and the machine that went into the whole installation. It was a 3d sound installation and the reciprocity between between the inhumane and the human eye. That's why we thought you, you would, you would you would be interested in what we do here. So yes, it would be great to hear as well, what your expectations are and what you're working on at the moment and how technology really figures in your work.
3.3378467559814453;12.294081687927246;0;For sure. Well, thank you for the introduction. And it's nice to meet you, virtually. So my name is Pietro. I'm originally from Italy. But I've been living in London for a few years. So my, my practice, my practice is sound based mainly by work with sound and programming. So is the boundaries between sound programming, my background is in music. So I think there's always that underlying area, let's say, so all my works kinda end up having some sort of compositional structure that belongs to music in a way. And what I'm interested in, in my practice, which is to explore the boundaries between the animate and the inanimate, and the organic and inorganic lately have been interested in looking at our interaction with the landscape and the changing landscape landscape itself. So sort of considering the landscape as constantly constantly evolving, and, and sort of moving away from the idea of landscape is merely the geographical scenery, let's say, but in an integration of all the entities that live within it, and the the relationship between these entities and the geography, so this landscape is a larger entity. So that's why I was more interested lately in exploring this idea of landscape with computation and with sounds. I'm going to share this screen because it's easy to talk. Where's the button? Sorry, supposed to notice? Can't find it? Somewhere? I can't find it, honestly. Where is it? Now share screen, it's been back and I found it. And so Okay, so some works, maybe that can give a better idea. So all my works kind of tend to have a life of their own. So what I try to do when I create work is to create the sort of compositional systems and systems that they have a life on their own through programming. So I set a simple set of rules for the systems to grow and develop by themselves. For example, this piece of work here is a sort of, it's a projection, but also, that continues growing, and is based on a sort of a series of genetic algorithms, they get informed by solar energies. It's quite a complex system. But essentially, it's this ever growing structure. The starting point of this work was the idea of the hallway, which is basically this, this path that emerges in forests by feet from people walking on it for centuries, and then animals walking on it, and then water goes through it. So it creates this sunken path they're called. So I wanted to create this but in a digital way. So is this algorithm. This is just a still image from it. There's a video somewhere. This was the work in progress. But it basically is like an ever growing structure. As I said, I work mainly with sounds and other work I've done is this piece already, but I'm trying to develop into something bigger, but essentially, it is a sound piece that is generated by a sort of a, it's called the ecosystemic algorithm. It's sort of like an ecosystem, but it's digital. And there are individual parties, this ecosystem that they have a life and they grow there, they learn and they die and when they die, they pass on the information to the younger generations. This is sort of the logic of this ecosystem. And what it tries to do is to sing in tune with each other basically. And there are several voices that grow the dead things. And this is just a score from a piece. Again, another piece just to give a better idea. And this, this was a bit more linear in a way to approach composition because this was basically translating how our body reacts to inflammation when you get heart surgery, it was working with some researchers. So that's why it's quite clinical. But basically your body when you go through heart surgery, sometimes rarely, but sometimes it happens that your body gets inflamed, and they kind of they're not too well, sometimes you die. So I was using the information from these hormones, how they behave with each other, to create a system that sort of mimics the state of these dynamics. And this is the score for it. And again, like the other piece it evolves, and it has a life on its own. This I'm gonna stop sharing. But yes, and in terms of this project, as I said, I am interested in things that grow and the influence on landscape when considering this larger landscape. So maybe this project came, in a way as the landscape, so maybe creating work that can live on. With a life on its own. Yes. Okay, that's me. Sorry for that, too much information.
-15.143919944763184;8.75232982635498;0;Thank you so much. Love to hear more about the depth of this project. Yesterday, like the whole project will be growing on throughout the next 10 months. So it is a process in itself. So I can already imagine an artificial being as part of it. Should we move on? It happened that another is next on our screen. And I saw Ada’s performance years ago. And recently, we got in touch. We were fascinated by project ‘the best facial’ that addresses others working on, I guess I just leave it to you to describe your work between the digital and the physical. And what are your… What are your expectations of this project?
19.775802612304688;14.75716781616211;0;Hey, everyone, others so I'm now in London, in I'm actually on the line that split Camden and Btrny two different Councils. And yeah, no, I got it during a performance that I was looking for. I'll share my screen as I'm talking as I was looking through this stone. Oh, sorry. I need to share the other screen, this one? Yeah. So yeah, that's the dome. And so that's the first time I met Agata from there in the performance. And that's and then later meeting at Iklectik during a sound event. And just like, Now, I say thinking of how like, why I'm here how I met each other. I think you have like, it's also what I'm interested in using performance as a way to meet people as a way to get to know each other. And in my practice, I use functioning as a method as a mode of operation of a given reality. So it's like this is a one a fictional character created from another and from there and that got me to see more things to see more possibilities or ways of being and ways of engaging with space with other people with the environment. So Yeah, sorry, I'm kind of thinking What should I say. And so now I'm finishing my PhD in University of Brighton School of Arts and Media practice based visually using performance situated ontology. And especially using fiction as a methodology to create a new mode of being and becoming. And, and the work that Agata mentioned earlier, the rest of the show is something that I've kind of  developed during the pandemic. So I, so this work is a series of one to one participatory facial sessions that I will have with participants. So I invite each individual participant to join me on Zoom and use this virtual touching that I'm referring to I can see here is this kind of touching from my end while they're on the other side of the screen, or their home and then two, so this virtual touching, of using the is way of touching, and also sound together to trigger and to to create a synthetic experience, to some participant told me that they actually feel itchiness when I touch their eyebrow, especially want to slowly stroke like that. And also superimposing their face with different landscapes is different, just footage I have seen during the pandemic to share this way to share, share, share what we see, what we experience, and to interrogate what we can see and experience through this way. So that's the most recent project I've been doing and then recently, from there developing this new possibly in your work, but it's more focusing on process which is what I'm I really, really fascinated with making work it's a process of working with people of like, trying to kind of like keep playing together that kind of process of finding out what what else is there we can play with. So I'm collaborating with this crow grapher, who is actually my old professor from college in my university in the United States. So we're trying to create this virtual Contact Improvisation using the similarity of ‘The Best Facial’, this telematic then as an experience for dancers, in UK and in the States, to interact with each other. So initially, the dancers, with dancers and eventually dancers, and public audience and public audience and the audience using this kind of big string of interaction using telematic tech technology, and that's how I sit with technology that and also is kind of come it came to me during COVID Is is like a craft that I see as I learned that you work with it, I use it. Not necessarily that it's the only thing I work with, but then if something is available, it has its own urgency that kind of needs me to work with it. Or I needed to work with what else? I think that's me at the moment.
-27.633588790893555;-2.6229407787323;0;Thank you so much. Is there anyone?
-27.150365829467773;-1.547182559967041;0;Thank you for inviting me. Can you hear me well?
20.632076263427734;13.52881908416748;0;Wait, is it better now? Yes, okay. It's okay. It's okay. Right. Okay. So um, yeah, my name is Maja and I studied Photography at RCA. So I guess. Yeah, that's how I know quite a few people over here. And, yeah, although I studied Photography, I feel like right now, I'm kind of working on an intersection of like different media like video, but also photography but as well writing and also I bring quite a lot of elements of sculpture into my work. I guess I'm interested in the physicality of the objects, which is kind of interesting in the context maybe of this peer group just because I think in terms of technology, I'm probably not the person who uses a lot of virtual kinds of things. I will be focused more on tactility and physical, feeling the objects themselves rather than working within the online environment. So I think I'm also like Ramona looking forward to kind of challenging that. And I guess in my practice, I kind of draw a lot on my personal experience of my heritage of being black Polish, Polish and Senegalese, or something that's one could call brownness and maybe interrogating certain sense of otherness, but also maybe not belonging or being in between cultures in that context. I guess I don't have any images to show you on my screen. But I think currently, the work that I've been like, developing sort of only in my head, is just this idea of thinking about the thinking about the hallucinatory vision of arthroscopy in terms of seeing yourself as the other and how can it help that kind of echos in terms of thinking about black identity, or people who are, who are like, have mixed race heritage, in terms of, you know, feeling always kind of, especially when thinking in context of Eastern Europe, and thinking of being like, always visible and kind of always seen as someone else and someone who's not at home, and they own culture? Yeah, I guess. In a nutshell. Yeah. 
21.48119354248047;15.615457534790039;0;Thanks, grasping on to what you said exactly what I said to Ramona before, I think this was the same kind of thinking, like, I know, your work. And I know, it's very material based and very tactile. And it's really interesting. What can happen, and, yeah, this is this idea of translation as I got I was talking about it before. Because maybe I mentioned one more thing, before we move to the next person that I thought about in terms of translation, is that when we were kind of conceptualising, the whole project and thinking about all these different things that led us to, to any and decide what we're going to do. One of the things connected to the accessibility aspects of the project was thinking about how we can present medium specific works to people, to disabled people? So for example, how can a visual work be presented to people who can't see without being this very, I think sometimes quite crude, audience simplified or this description like how can we work in a way that these experiences will be on equal level and that this is not just going to be a description of a work but the work in itself and then the project changed a lot in the meantime, but this idea of like, translation of material into digital and like different mediums into other mediums and maybe somehow finding a way of, of synthesising or maybe not synthesising, but like creating these parallel experiences in this online platform is also something that we want to explore. 
-19.020139694213867;13.426375389099121;0;So, Natalia disappeared, but I don't know. You're the next one.
-18.458534240722656;13.411274909973145;0;Sorry, I'm very frazzled. I have COVID which is wonderful. So I'm, I'm going to be probably short. I am Polish and I live in London. And I don't know how we met, actually, with the old days, but I don't know. 
-18.99894142150879;7.263861656188965;0;But I think it was on the occasion of this project. But coming across your work through friends of friends, like friends participating in the same exhibitions, I think or something like that.
28.87921905517578;-1.1921639442443848;0;So I am a bit of a magpie. So I collect lots of things and I also work with different technologies. So both like I do a little bit of CGI, sometimes. I made sculptures and I perform, and I made some genetics recently, more and more wearable, sort of wearable things that also make sounds. But I'm just sort of like moving in between these things. I'm not good at any of these things. But I'm just sort of like, I don't know, like, picking up on things that I think are relevant to the project more in this way. And in terms of this project that we are, we are beginning now, I think, because one of the things that I am looking at is sort of at some point, I had this idea about creating like, online environments, which would represent something that maybe is like a Holly Well, or like a shrine, or like all these references from I'm talking about Eastern European cultures, but also like sort of British Holly Wells and this sort of, like, old sort of ideas of collecting objects and bringing objects to places and intentions and various different, like, semi spiritual vibes. And I sort of wanted to assemble into something where people can bring all these different assets, which can be words or sounds or objects, and to place them somewhere, online somewhat, and to share them and interact with each other. And, somehow when I heard about this project, I thought that it could potentially somehow connect to these ideas that I have, I guess, um, yeah. I don't know if I want to say anything else. Yes.
-27.365901947021484;9.160649299621582;0;And then, Natalia will be leading, also one of the sessions.
-29.41090965270996;3.167726755142212;0;Yes. Later, later in the year,
2.133779287338257;1.698319673538208;0;From the garden? Yes. Oh, yes. Also, I live in a housing co-op. And I am a pond officer, which means I'm looking after the ponds, which means many things. But yeah, but so I think I will like to sort of maybe during this, I will load into the, I guess, the ecosystem, and different infrastructures that we have in place in the co op and the, I guess the relationship between, I don't know, us and environment and humans and hybrid species. And said that, so this, this is another thing that I'm interested in, both in my practice and maybe just my lived experience of living in a particular infrastructure at the moment.
-26.932031631469727;-0.4596048891544342;0;I'm looking forward to meet you physically at one point, the feeling. So I think we will move now. Thank you so much, Natalia. I think it's right, Rachel is the next on the grid.
-27.447649002075195;7.432621955871582;0;I apologise for cutting in and out a bit. 
19.795124053955078;15.263303756713867;0;Yeah, my name is Rachel. I'm Canadian, spent a bit of time in Los Angeles and ended up moving to London. I guess in terms of my practice, it kind of runs the gamut from like very sort of process based sculptures. It's a bit of amateur archaeology. So a little bit of performance lectures, and I've also worked a bit in art and tech. A lot of that was through a collaboration with another artist named Sarah Derat called Digital&Dead so we did some augmented reality like an augmented reality sculpture and a very kind of simple thought. That whole project was, you know, looking at digital afterlife and how we know how our social media zombified social media presence is lived on and continues to sort of have its own afterlife outside of us. I guess in terms of, of my personal work, I think in a lot of ways, I'm primarily interested in how data is sort of organised taxonomies put in categories and sorted but, you know, some interesting like, the politics of like, you know, why, why certain, you know, say certain historic narratives get written in particular ways. How, you know, history is constructed. You know, why certain things are put under one category or another. I think in a lot of ways, you know realising during the pandemic that a big part of the way that I think the way I collect things and organise ideas is influenced by not being neurotypical by having a brain that isn't entirely neurotypical. So that's been something I've been thinking about a lot lately. And I think in terms of this project, one of the things I'm potentially interested in is figuring out a way to use wiki systems to create co-writing projects. So, you know, potentially potentially using, like, a structure like Wikipedia, to, you know, potentially using that kind of structure to allow various authors to write kind of across and in between other people's writing. I'm sorry, I'm, like, totally spaced out. So if this makes any sense, but uh, yeah. Cool. Thank you. 
-26.960325241088867;-1.2184959650039673;0;Thank you, there will be something about collective writing and writing with machines that we wanted to investigate. So interesting to hear this right, Rachel, thank you so much. I think we can move to be the last piece. 
20.278194427490234;14.237296104431152;0;Hi, everyone. Thank you, for all, nice hearing, it was really nice to hear about everyone's practice. So I kind of like my practice lies between research and making. I guess, I've kind of started also while COVID started to reflect Okay, what am I doing? How do I want this to move forward? And then I started to dive into the academic world of research. So I started to write a PhD proposal on the specificity of dating apps and how we can submit a dating app. And then now I moved on to write a new PhD proposal in the art department, this time on cyber feminism. And like looking at different manifestos that were written in recent years. So the Xeno feminist manifesto and glitch feminism are so London based, actually Goldsmiths based. And so I'm kind of looking at how performance online can subvert the image of what we have offered online. So I also have this interest in my practice. And I try to submit things by doing performances online with friends. And I look at all that care as well. I think that's a big, big topic. And recently, I've started to really explore this idea of technology and accessibility again, which I think resonates with lots of people here. So this idea of how, so my dad is going blind. And so we've looked at different technology on what we call emancipation to enhance his seeing, and we've tried lots of new technologies that are based on reality and virtual reality, which of course, did not work. So then we started to kind of question what are those uses of technology and trying to normalise bodies that are disabled and how we can Yeah, how technology does that and promote that similar to like the way social media kind of operates. So I'm currently making a film, which is a short film that has been supported financially by the programme I'm in at the moment. And I'm looking exactly at that idea of what this technology for blind people offers and how we can think of technology in a different way. So I'm trying to propose a less cognitive way of thinking of technology, but a more sensible approach to it. So then I kind of did a performance where I invited lots of people to wear those glasses. I made myself and their glasses that are blurring the vision a bit. And so yeah, so you've probably seen the film and you'll see the reaction of the performance, but that's what I'm kind of exploring and I'm also lucky enough to teach quite a lot. And I'm also doing all of this with the young students so trying to use social media platforms in different ways and which is really interesting, of course to work with the younger audience. And therefore this I think we've met for this workshop, but I'm quite familiar with a few of you in the group. I think Sara, Natalia also I know do very well. And I think maybe Rachel, I was listening to you. I think we have met through was it for them? Yeah, I think it was with some maybe you did a show there. Right. In? Must know, we haven't seen, it was it was it was. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Nice. Yeah.
-13.228448867797852;-1.028558373451233;0;It's nice. We have a common interest. Yep. And yes, project, I think we've been speaking about, of course workshops, but also, I have an interest in also looking at net art and what net art used to do in the beginning of the internet and how it has this promise of being something then what internet is now. So I've always been keen on developing a website that fully has this finger, you could go through different pages and things will unfold, similar to what Net Art was doing in the early 90s. And yeah, so that's, I think, what we've been discussing a bit like this, this idea of penetrating your website, and maybe see betting through, I don't know how to code, which is a shame, but I would love to, and then trying to find other scripts somehow for for this website, or platform. Cool, thank you. 
14.572854995727539;6.994758605957031;0;It's interesting because I think it was after the first zoom chat we had like, I don't know, when was that like, half a year ago or more? And I remember we were talking about your work with students and also, these avatars. And also, you mentioned, glitch feminism was just something that like, at that point, was kind of coming to me at different points, but I still haven't read it. But then I actually was like, Okay, I'm going to read it. And I have read it since. And it would be amazing to also maybe, yeah, definitely delve into that. Things. So many things. Yeah. And it feels like everyone should read it. It's quite easy to read as well. So it's definitely a great book to unpack. Yeah.
-23.58203887939453;9.532686233520508;0;And I think relevant to people, even in this group from so many different points of reference.
-29.974519729614258;1.067429542541504;0;Yes, I think maybe I'll mention another book.
13.239617347717285;18.329204559326172;0;I can talk a little bit about the origins of the name, the title just happened to be it on its own. And the whole story goes back to last summer when I bumped into Ada at Iklectik in South London, there was a book fair and Ada suggested buying this book called Pharmaco AI. I don't know if you've heard about this book written by Kendric Allado McDowell. It's a book written jointly by the artist and also AI a kind of language generating model called GPT 3. You can see different fonts in the book. So one font is for the human, human voice. And the other font designates the digitally constructed human-like language. And there is one, one chapter that talks about what hyperspace is, it's this different dimension that we can get into through art. It's also about the space in which we perceive the world in a non normative way, I would say. And it just happened to be the title but we've been reflecting on what could the outcomes of our peer groups be because we would like after each of the sessions to upload some traces online onto this new platform in becoming to be able to share with what's happening here in between us in this closed safe space to share it with wider audiences for for the platform visitors to also be able to have some kind of response and some kind of input to what we do, what could shape our future meetings, and we thought that it would be nice to also work with with the machine with the mechanic model to create some kind of a trace. So the idea is to transcribe the sound recording after our sessions and feed it into the Open AI model. And wait to receive a reply from the computer generated voice. So it will be a computer generated text, there will be kind of one voice combining all of our voices together. It's it's also a process through which we want to explore and to question what agency means what ownership means.
7.840964317321777;14.399730682373047;0;Yeah, ownership of our different ideas in this. I mean, there have been discussions about this for a while now, where different ideas come from and like, when they're always informed by all these conversations, we have the books that we read and everything and so I guess this is maybe like an experiment in manifesting it somehow. So like, the voice becomes the voice of, of everybody. Like it's, it's one organism, essentially. And also, we also in the process, I think lose a bit of agency over like the actual processing of the material, which is also something that is going to be an interesting thing to see, I guess, this element of unpredictability, and artificial creativity, that is quite a big topic to explore. 
14.203716278076172;10.303155899047852;0;Yeah, it's a, it's an experiment, and we'll see how it goes. But we were just really thinking about the best way to incorporate these traces after every session, somehow, but in a way that maybe would not be too direct and not too controlled by us. And like, lose this kind of idea of, of curating. Which also leads us to another point that we feel a bit strange in this setup, because so far all our projects were very curatorial in a sense, even if they were not exactly like institutional exhibitions. So we were like choosing a group of people telling everyone what to do. The outcomes were kind of preconceived. And so this is the first time that we're just, we're just here, participating like everyone else. Yes, that's why that's why we are organising these peer groups for security, horizontality.
3.1466782093048096;15.297536849975586;0;Yeah. And also I work with Agata and this curatorial platform, but I'm also an artist, so I will be also doing my research and like making work and yeah, so it's like different, I guess engaged on different levels. So we it's, it's also our question, our question to you to think of say, after every session, what, what was left with you what kind of format would fit to be left on the platform? And so after, after each of the three groups, we will take care of an upload, and create some kind of an interaction with a wider audience, and to  have it treated as a collective research. As I immediately put a few words about the process of making the platform. Yeah. Erik, would you would you like to share a really basic, basic plan, how, how the platform is being constructed, what it will be at the beginning and how we will move into the actual space, because we're thinking of launching the, the space in less than two weeks and at the beginning it will be, it will be a skeleton of of what it will become in December. But we want we want to treat it as a process.
-24.196151733398438;7.1384453773498535;0;So it will be a gradual, gradual birth. This phase. I see yes, maybe Erik would like to tell us a few words, what the idea is for the prototype version?
18.158077239990234;13.46642017364502;0;Hey, so Well, first I have to say, I've really enjoyed listening to everyone's introductions, and I'm already super inspired. I've had loads of ideas for the platform, how we can kind of fuse, fuse people's works and ways of working on to the platform. Can you actually hear me by the way? Cool. So, yeah, I'm not really sure what you'd like me to say about the construction. But it's basically at the moment, it's just a skeleton. I've been, I've been looking at first I, I've basically made sure that the that the kind of like the web servers running, and everything's working, and I've been building the back end, and the way that I like to build websites is that I make them into kind of like web apps. So that involves writing like an algorithmic system basically to, to, to basically, dynamically create the content from the data instead of having to kind of like manually inserting every upload into the, into the code. So I guess, I guess what I'm thinking initially is something like, a fairly kind of, basically like a I'm not really sure I'm able to verbalise it at the moment. What I'm trying to say. So it's probably the thought is not ready, ready to come out.
0.7799633145332336;4.196771144866943;0;I think it's really, I mean, it's really early. But as we are here all together, you want at this point to have any questions or thoughts, but as I say, like, it's fine. It's really thank the first meeting, if anyone wants to ask anything to add or to Erik, then yeah, maybe that's, that's better?
-16.578407287597656;6.0479841232299805;0;Yes, we I think we should also mention that as, as it's the first project that we really seriously work with technology. It's also about questioning it. It's about questioning its limits. Its really understanding what it contains where they were within itself. I don't know what the discussion is.
10.457050323486328;3.6673665046691895;0;I have a quick question to Erik have I really should in relation to the web design, not design the website building? Like, would it be like in relation to what Agata was saying, how this audio recording gonna be put into open and then I'm not really sure it's really out of my I'm just like, thinking possibilities might not be practical. Like that. What the odds of that being put into the eye, will that play a part in this into building the website? Without taking the role? That what? You're okay. Yeah. Yeah. 
13.750482559204102;19.624109268188477;0;So basically, First, I need to clarify that what I think what Agata was talking about was that the audio would be first transcribed into text, and then the text would be text that would be fed into the model. And that's, I mean, the idea is, isn't necessarily to use Open AI as GPT 3, but something similar If not that so a language model of of generating something something generative where we have some kinds of materials, responses from these workshops, in whatever media, they they kind of take form, and then use some kind of kind of generative model to, to kind of respond to, to our thoughts, I guess. But the way that it would play a role in constructing the website is that I kind of, I want to as we're building it throughout the year, I think even though I'd like to have quite a kind of set structure in place of how things and like, elements on the website are going to be, I'd still like to kind of devise the website, using the materials as we go along, as opposed to kind of designing it now and then just adding some materials. So if I'm not sure if that answers your question, or if I'm not sure if I interrupted your question,
-11.055627822875977;8.112098693847656;0;Whatsoever, I'm just thinking, I only recently got to know that idea of DAU decentralised, autonomous organisation, that's what when I was thinking about this group, I was in that idea of DAU of how can we create this decentralised, autonomous organisation? From what I know of DAU that they use this kind of voting system? So I was thinking, how are we gonna interact with this thing of, like, what could we produce work that we want? And it's quite subjective. And when put into AI collectively, I wonder how do we access to be able to interact with what comes out of that input?
-11.125664710998535;17.582551956176758;0;Yeah, I think that's a good thing to think about.
-7.543039798736572;19.08598518371582;0;Is it about responding to the output we get from any, any kind of model? Other Yeah.
8.794041633605957;11.567790985107422;0;Yeah, I think I will say maybe like, example, the, if we were to give like a paradigm like periphery to AI say that we want to see more busy images and then more busy images, but then what that paradigm prefers is set what? So how do we create something that is not necessarily I mean, it will be interesting what we want collectively, but also if there's possible possibility of creating something of value or not with it's not how to say no, it's not necessarily what we want, like a specific thing we want, like without a limit of what we want
-3.1522581577301025;-5.377256393432617;0;I understand what you're saying. Yeah. Yeah. And it sounds interesting.
-28.860734939575195;10.109131813049316;0;Is it about training training the model to get
-9.979918479919434;19.541078567504883;0;I think it's more about kind of directing, restricting No.
-10.118520736694336;19.11477279663086;0;Yeah, I think. So I'm kind of taking the whole house sideways
-7.563774108886719;17.226518630981445;0;kind of working with the machine to achieve a joint outcome? did. Did we also have some kind of control? Yeah. So random? Yes. Yeah. This is,
6.213188648223877;16.278989791870117;0;like certain, because it's interacting with us a certain sense of like asking in it, but it's not made by us. Make something it is like an environment like the planet planet, that is not the planet Earth, we're living in a generally in a way  to influence what is becoming where we put it, the input we have of like, as per making work, that actually this was machine or artificial intelligence, will that like, automatically generate something without, that is not produced by us. But then we're feeding in information so that maybe something else could become self sufficient? Huh.
-13.653436660766602;13.416719436645508;0;This is interesting what you mentioned, because for example, even though the book that I mentioned, was written by, by this artificial model, anything that was produced by it was still edited by the human. So it's, it's, it's in a relationship that goes both ways. I don't know if this is something that you're thinking of that we feed in things, we get outcomes, but then still, we can work with them further. 
14.026692390441895;11.595388412475586;0;For it is also seen, it's also evolving, because the more time we spend with it, the more we feed it, the more it has these parameters that you were talking about, I guess, like the walls are slowly being kind of like from a sketch. But then like, this is the question, like, do we, like want this? Like, what are these walls? I guess it's also like another thing, which is in the back of the project, and how we are trying, we still trying to figure this out, what we want to achieve somehow, at least at some point, is the interaction from the outside so from the audience, and actually create a kind of tool for the audience to interact with the material to feed back into the platform that we can then take and maybe take to another session. So it becomes like, not a very close circle of us just thinking and doing things but it kind of comes out and then an out and then. So maybe then if that actually happens, and we actually succeed in creating this interaction with the audience, maybe other voices can start to be fed into this thing, and then broaden the kind of universe that is built from us. But then maybe, yeah,
-25.06045913696289;13.084750175476074;0;I guess we can also mention, another idea that we had is to create platforms own voice for
-24.111309051513672;10.111919403076172;0;levelling a lot of different names
-11.177050590515137;7.496909141540527;0;and leaders, but I think it's good just to throw them into space and, and I hope we will also have input from you to kind of mould these ideas into one. One organism that will live on this platform. If we have visual material, there will always be audio, audio part of it for anyone to be able to access, access your work there. So we're thinking of maybe also creating some kind of distinct voice that would be part of this space, or that would be this organism that this creation will become. But as Erik says, it's really early in the process, we still don't have the proper skeleton we are gathering material to be ready to publish the first version in in a couple of weeks. And I guess, from then, after our first, after the first peer group, I think we'll know better what, what the potential is.
15.668073654174805;6.290994644165039;0;Can I just have one question to what you said? Like, because I don't know if I understood that, right, at some point when you said about, like, how what we feed can actually impact the build of the website itself? Did you mean that like, this has been somehow incorporated into the coding of the website, and this way, like this affects the environment? Or did I just like made this up? I don't know if I, I don't think I explained it very well. But
6.357378005981445;15.761542320251465;0;I think I kind of understand if I understand right is or understand myself, like I was, I was like, basically thinking about the example of the planned toy, the link that was put in the chat. So they create this like plan to this flower by fading into like, crypto block. So it's, it's, it's written on blockchain and by fading the, this plantoids the plan to it eventually will be to have Library's own and then generate, like commission other people or machines to make it work. So I guess it's a kind of list of what we talk about that becomes part of the coding process.
-25.607830047607422;5.719211578369141;0;If you mean something like permaculture, perma permaculture,
-20.55478858947754;9.428838729858398;0;of the virtual, I think,
-29.459856033325195;1.9492720365524292;0;yes, I think permaculture literally just you have a raised hand
24.978282928466797;-17.6690616607666;0;I wasn't gonna stick. But, um, maybe it's relevant to that topic. But I was just thinking I've never worked directly with AI but I'd be interested to see in the sense of maybe one out of you asking how it will relate to our conversations and kind of peer community making. But I think as we go along, we're already influencing each other as to what we put on the table and share and with that being given, also, I don't know how the AI would be programmed to generate new material but then have a life of its own. But I think it'd be interesting to have that like extra entity to then also collaborate with us in the sense of what it gives back to us as this kind of other brain that kind of brainstorms all of us together and then generate new ideas from us of what could be this kind of becoming because bring forward things that we wouldn't altogether maybe you know, together revise in this way so exactly something that we were thinking about of this one thing being multiple voices that we have here you know, bringing one bird what bird containing everybody in this one body this one voice that would be the output
-28.9278507232666;8.391434669494629;0;Shall we do some practicals? 
-14.018548965454102;8.451868057250977;0;Yes. And also we were thinking of ways of making the whole project public and if you have any specific ideas or preferences of media channels you use and what works for you online and what does not it would be really helpful for us to take into consideration throughout the whole process I guess this is for the beginning. So we can maybe share the screen of the project plan.
6.437100410461426;4.389257431030273;0;Oh, yeah. I need to find it. It's here Yes. This is so at the end that we just wanted to ask you about practical things like the dates and just to confirm with everyone this is a very, like, as you can see, everything is to be confirmed. So these dates They're not set in stone. But basically as long as we are all together we wanted to ask if Fridays work for everyone, or if we should think of another day. And then this is like roughly the plan for all the sessions, which might kind of shift around and we might change specific dates. I know that it is around June or May, anyway, it doesn't matter. Just roughly kind of roughly, we wanted to ask, which days work for everyone whether we should? Yeah, basically, shall we stay with Friday, but maybe do it a little bit later? Like that six or later? We do have some other days. So the month I don't know. If anyone can't do Fridays, maybe then speak.
-25.405620574951172;6.982662200927734;0;I was just looking. So the live event you're planning on near Christmas, right? Yeah. Is that the final date? It seems to be confirmed. But no, it's now mid mid December.
13.194517135620117;11.43027400970459;0;But yeah, we thought about this. It is kind of like when we are planning the project, because this is just a version for you. But the whole project has all these other things that have to come in place as well. And it took us to mid December. However, I mean, we're flexible with that. And if it turns out that it's not working for us as well, we can. I guess we can shift things around. But in terms of like for all the sessions to happen, and to have this kind of like a little bit of break over the summer. We also allocated time for everyone individually to maybe contact Erik, if there's specific questions regarding works and like how the works are gonna be put on the platform and stuff like that. That took us to December which Yeah, I mean that we were not extremely happy that it was close to Christmas. But actually, maybe.
-12.86902904510498;2.696147918701172;0;I was just asking, I guess, because I'm not in London. So I need to book a flight at some point. I'm not sure if I'm in London, but yeah. All right.
-3.80133318901062;-8.613409042358398;0;I mean, we can speak about this further on. Once we also confirm the venue, which should be in the next few months. I think by the summer, probably we should have concrete. Okay. But yeah, anyways, like in terms of the Friday meetings, is that, is that something that works for everyone? I'll stop now.
-26.923917770385742;5.6646342277526855;0;I mean, things are out there online.
-11.168299674987793;4.76047420501709;0;Okay, so this one won't be. And I think and I think potentially, what did we say as well, I just wanted to say that even though we have final events in space, and it will be an amazing opportunity for us to get together face to face, because we work with technology, we we hope this can this can this will enable us to be to be present with everyone that cannot make it to then. So we will try to find ways for anyone that is not able to travel or is not able to be in the same place as we are to still to be able to participate in a non embodied way.
-4.070042610168457;-2.682878255844116;0;Yeah, like there isn't going to be anything that is going to be exclusive. We don't expect everyone to be able, even though it would be great, we will try to find ways for it to also work at a distance.
-1.9976797103881836;0.9779125452041626;0;That was what I was thinking in terms of workshop in the garden. I mean, we can easily livestream it. Yeah, that's not a problem at all. So especially these days, we plan the next we expect anyone to know and I mean, it's just we will. I think we will talk about this one in particular, which you Natalia  how you envisaged it in the best way. We just thought that maybe it would be nice to come together for the people that are in London. Having said that, they'll definitely have the kind of zoom aspect of it.
-27.266050338745117;8.422167778015137;0;To be away and stupid. dissipate.
8.156160354614258;3.182424783706665;0;And I feel like it's not really fair. No. Saying like for people who are in London together, but yeah, we'll see. Most of it though, like 80% of them is supposed to be zoom based.
-32.4959602355957;6.013807773590088;0;I think would be would be good to share with you these tentative plan with the dates and maybe all of you could respond if if they seem fine
-24.42584991455078;6.140747547149658;0;as well if they're more like afternoon or evenings, are they always similar times or?
-3.2887134552001953;-2.2066643238067627;0;And this one was specifically pushed earlier, but we were thinking of maybe evening. Yeah, like 6pm, I think
-4.201499938964844;-2.0147957801818848;0;6pm. Just to make sure that even if people have things on on a Friday, like, Yeah,
-32.457401275634766;5.991622447967529;0;but we we can share these specific dates, these specific Fridays, and maybe you could reply to us if this Friday evening is fine. And it will try to work around everyone's schedule.
-24.646751403808594;8.681608200073242;0;I know some some people because Sara, you are an hour ahead or two. It was Erik
-25.988224029541016;8.194421768188477;0;Now, France, the same? Price is the same? Or one hour after an hour? Yeah, at least one hour.
-32.332550048828125;4.227652549743652;0;I was just saying that, like, around this time is fine. But if it's later than I mean, I mean, it's only a few Fridays. So I mean, it's fine. As long as I know the dates, I'm flexible.
-11.210160255432129;6.243389129638672;0;the dates with us. But it was really nice to hear you all today. Wrapping up to also see everyone in one space. I think so unless you want to add anything. So we are thinking of the next meeting, just this month to be still the same month. So we hope we'll be able to gather at the end of March for a workshop with Lea. But we will share more information about this with you soon. And I guess maybe we should leave it here and just wait for all the ideas and questions to come up. And please do share whatever, whatever comes to your mind.
-14.169031143188477;2.152405023574829;0;I just wanted to say that that Lea and myself, we are just finishing our peer forum in Camden Arts Centre. And on the 12th and 13th we have some events that are also on subject of care, which became sort of the main event theme. So if you are around in London, please do come there will be workshops and various different activities we're going to run and, and speak about stuff and yeah.
-1.4252862930297852;1.122314453125;0;Yeah. Can I just quickly say one thing as well? Yeah, this I was just wondering if it would be possible to kind of organise ourselves into some kind of social space somewhere. Just so that I mean, I mean, cuz I mean, I don't have anyone's email or anything, but even better than just having everyone's email addresses. It might be good to have a shared slack or Discord server or, or something where we can, like talking. That's around, right. Is Discord or Whatsapp group? Would it? What are your preferences? Say this, 
-29.27815055847168;2.611961841583252;0;I used Discord before. Yes, we could.
-9.992390632629395;-17.595125198364258;0;Either one. We'll set something up.
-2.410374879837036;-18.196014404296875;0;Okay. Cool. Mm hmm. Maybe you could also think of something like this for the platform itself. Maybe it just could be connected. Okay, Well have nice evenings. Thank you very much, everyone. Thank you for sharing your professional personal stories. And we'll be in touch with you soon with more updates and hopefully see you still this month in a little bit different format. Thank you. 
9.998368263244629;9.655851364135742;1;All right. This is for this transcript. But yeah, so we've done a few meditative sessions together, of just being online together. And that's something maybe I wanted to start with. And the idea for today was very much to think about new ways. Again, like I was saying earlier, of communicating through, of course, the tool of zoom and through other tools, with AI, or even like Google Translate and things like that. So it's going to be quite playful. It's also, I'm kind of pulling from different workshops I'm doing and for example, I did something last week with kids and AI, like image generating AI. And the result was really incredible. With these kids, they really didn't understand what was happening. And they were really questioning me also, why are we doing this? Why is this? I couldn't even answer like, why are we using an AI that is just giving us random things. And you asked us previously to think about stuff. And now we are just giving whatever we thought about to this AI to generate other things like why. And it was really hard for me to reply to them on why we were doing this. So I think maybe, maybe we just carry on exploring this and try to find why we are doing this. Maybe that's also back to what you were saying earlier. So maybe it's just about carrying on making and producing and seeing where this takes us.
15.325826644897461;10.420136451721191;1;But yeah, I just wanted to start first with a really kind of simple thing that I don't know if you guys know this artist called she's from the Netherlands, she was in net art called Annie Abrahams. And she does during lockdown and she was doing this meditation just disturbed feeling listening to each other sessions for a really long time. And I thought that we could just start with 10 minutes of us without mics on so everyone with the mic on and I will put a timer on and for maybe 10 is quite long, maybe just five minutes so it's kind of putting us together in the same place just like closing our eyes with the mic with our mics on and our webcam ons. And just like kind of being together trying to find common space even though we are in different spaces now. So it's just a matter of being together in silence but it's nice to listen to other people's noises also around so we have really like the conscious of everyone so I'll just put the timer on and if you just all open your mics and just close your eyes and Yeah would you be there to get there for five minutes?
-1.354866862297058;4.367687225341797;1;Day Right Hey guys Right To know right five minutes so thank you for all being attentive to this I just wonder if you could all write three words on a piece of paper somewhere on your laptop wherever you are that kind of comes to come to you as you were doing this maybe it's a song maybe it's something inside that happened inside maybe you felt connected with something through a sound or yeah anything free words can be an emotion can be a verb can be a word. Okay great. And so now the idea is to work on something that's well honoured, like developing a new way of interacting and communicating. So how we can, by using those tools, which are zoom and other, like care tools that are given to us online, how we can find new ways of communicating.
-3.4323015213012695;0.32096928358078003;1;So when I was thinking about that I just thought about encryption, that was one of my first foods and how, yeah, like encryption having, like how people just managed to communicate without, for example, in terms of civilians, so how you communicate without being held or without being recognised. And I remember doing this workshop with a great hacker activist artist called Heath Banting. And we did this thing that was called I don't even remember the name, but it was, it was a way of doing cryptid communication. That's, it's, it's used in different political groups, such as the Irish Republican Army or the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. And it's quite a simple way of communicating. So the idea is that I mean, the technique relies on you need to have a sender and a receiver that are possessing one unique knowledge between the two of them from which they can refer to in order to exchange messages. And this unique knowledge is for intimacy. So the idea is going to be to create this intimacy. So we'll have one sender, one receiver, and we'll create intimate, intimate dialogues. And then we'll play a bit around with that. So each person will make breakout rooms and the idea is that I will pair you randomly. I think I can do that with breakout rooms. So I think it's going to be we. How many are we?
-5.367873191833496;-14.43331241607666;1;123456 1120 Okay,
1.3665732145309448;9.26996898651123;1;That's good. But Natalia, she, Natalia, you can participate? Can you? Can I use? Yeah, I mean, now I can now yeah, no one is here. So. Okay. Okay, good. So that's good interaction at work. And so, I will let you off for 15 minutes. And the idea is for you, as opposed to create a code dictionary that invents this new way of communicating. And you will spend 15 minutes together exchanging information based upon intimate experience that you have had, or, for example, you can speak, I mean, it's something quite personal, you can speak for example, about your childhood, or maybe something you ate yesterday, or something you are seeing now in the space. And through this, you will start to create an addiction dictionary of scents and meanings. And then when we will come back, I will give to each of you a word. And you will have to make the other person guess what words I am you're speaking about. So let's say I'll give you the colour blue. Let's say I give to Sarah, the colour blue. And then Sarah, you were paired with Eric, for example. And you will have to make Eric guess what this world by only using the language you've communicated together. So it's it can be something that is recognisable, that we can't guess as an audience, we can not guess that you are trying to make every guest that you are, yeah, let's try to make it guess that is the colour blue. So by that you need to use the language that you shared just the two of you together. So let's say I mean, I don't know if it's clear enough, but let's say for example, you have it, Eric. Like that, that drink that cocktail you had yesterday, and then he knows that cocktail. Exactly, exactly. I say like the colour of that cocktail. Only if we've used colour in the in the conversation, I guess.
1.8064991235733032;8.78360652923584;1;Yes, if you have used colour in the conversation, but also, you will don't want to say blue because that's the world you are trying to that's the word that we should that as an audience we shouldn't get. And the idea is that if the audience find the word before, Eric, but it means that your perception was not good enough because we managed to get so it can't it can't be like a shot, you know, because we will get it too easily. So it's really about avoiding abuse thing and really relying on the intimacy that you guys share together. But I think it will make more sense once you once we get going with the world. But for the time being is 15 minutes of sharing, sharing things that are quite personal to you. And, and maybe you can find common threads also within your sharing. So that might be a good thing to refer to. I remember when you spoke about this thing that I also went through, when I was five years old, we did it together and that might just lead to something else in this world. We are trying to make his guess. So I don't know if that was clear. It's hard because it's about finding like, like developing new ways to avoid people recognising what you're trying to say. But I think we will we will manage I think for 15 minutes, maybe now it's just about having conversation with your partner. So I'll just make break out rooms. Can I do that? Oh,
-25.499839782714844;2.0750772953033447;1;doesn't seem that I'm able to break out rooms. Again, you have to make another host but leave is a co host. Yes. Okay.
-3.428337574005127;-9.592690467834473;1;I can do that. Because if I make Erik host, it will disturb the recording. So yeah, okay. Yeah, if you can do breakout rooms. And it doesn't matter because we don't necessarily need to record the breakout rooms. This is intimate. Yeah, exactly. And also you will not be able to record every now. So I think on Saturdays you can go ahead with the change that will enable us okay. All right. I'm stopping the recording. 
1.2639689445495605;9.306564331054688;1;Thank you. Great. So I hope you guys had a nice conversation. So what I'm So step two now is I will be generating words online, I'm using this website called random word generator.com. Which gives me words that I will share with only one of the person in each jewels. And then this person will have to make the partner guess what the word is, by using the vocabulary that you guys have developed together. So the idea is that your partner should find the word before everybody else. Let's say I give a concrete example. Let's say I give to Maya, the colour blue. Who has to you work with? Who were you with? Cato? Yeah, you will have to make clear targets blue. And if you say, let's say, oh, it's the colour of the sky. Of course, every everyone will be able to say blue because we can all relate to that. But then if you say, are remember, we spoke about that thing when we were walking, and we looked up, and we saw this, and that, you know, that that became that becomes blue and we can relate to it. And we can't guess because we haven't been in your conversation. So yeah, the idea is to try to stay as closer as you conversation and what you've shared intimate intimately together, rather than trying to be more general because if you are general then we will then the audience will guess the world. So maybe, if you guys and maybe my time this because we shouldn't take too long, maybe three minutes. And then if you don't guess then that's fine then that, I guess, because it hasn't worked. If no one guesses so I'll just privately chat. 
-9.585657119750977;-16.99909019470215;1;So maybe I'll start with Yeah, with my actually I'll just send you a word. And so that's what you have to make Pietro guess and timing so if you remember the story that I told you
2.672224283218384;-12.100199699401855;1;Yeah, yeah. So I remember when I was walking through the forest, yes. And and each time I saw the car I was thinking yeah, that might be maybe someone inside yeah and that's why I was hiding Do you know who could that have possibly been? Your Mom No, no your auntie yes yes nice really quick yeah sick this is such a sign as well you just talk about your hands and then I give you the world and this strange good well done okay, great. So I guess now I can share I can send you or maybe we just do another group and then we'd come back to 
-6.121217727661133;-13.57396125793457;1;Okay, so either you I'm gonna send you a world okay
-21.618064880371094;2.109769344329834;1;so okay it's hmm this is very difficult about the fish the the cat on a pedestal and talking about how our life are how they exist in relation to the cat. And okay, this is difficult
-21.061580657958984;3.3733255863189697;1;Who is this partner? Me really tiny Yes. And talking about how like the cat owning the moment and this all come into the life the life what of life of our relation to the cat and cats relation to us and coming to how we understand where we are like is we're talking about this like cat oriented ontology of learning from cat and how the cat relate to the world and how we relate to the cat sorry, synchronicity. Not another word, but I like that word to its
-21.50263786315918;5.485321521759033;1;meaning was it meaning Yeah. The code fade the guts you know, it got to the guts, you know? Oh, this I tried to avoid saying the word I could soon but I could I hacked your your story because I could sympathise because I see a lot of meaning of existence into them. My Existence has different meaning because of them.
-2.305870771408081;-10.858980178833008;1;So when we're done, we're done. Citizen. We're done guys for try. Our language is universal. It wasn't so secret. Yeah, exactly. Well, yeah, that was a tough one also to have meaning, you know, that's like the root of it. So yeah. Not easy. Okay. So another group, so maybe he will send you a world and you will with a getter, right. Okay, do you want to see how intimate we are as a couple? Locally dressed? No way. It's crazy. What a coincidence and you put this thing to bed. It's just it's a t-shirt from radio station resonance.
15.628782272338867;11.265045166015625;1;Ah we’ll present Okay, Eric, you have the world. Your mic I'm just trying to think about how I could describe this so you know, how we were talking about. So in what you were doing, or the kind of other thing that we were talking about that that you got me quite excited about and I was saying that I'd have to try it out too. We were talking about how basically how bodies just kind of or how we just lose identity when we enter this shared space it's kind of like when we lose when we lose identity. Our bodies are just reduced to something something physical, without any of these kinds of like without without Yeah, without any hierarchies without any identities. Our bodies are just reduced to something in in the in the shared space reduced and something something physical sound flesh might have. Read us to this so I guess. Sorry. Is it the presence? No doubt And similarly when we're kind of like in the activity that I was talking about when we were talking about intimacy or intimate experiences similarly when we enter that space and we're just kind of like leaving everything behind yeah I'm not really sure if there's another way to approach this maybe three things that we've been talking about we choose not spirit so feeling to sensation I know we learn. it's top one. I mean it's very difficult like just trying to speak in the kind of stay within the themes that we were talking about but can I so can I say yeah, so it was matter. Of course this is everything I guess you could try to get like after once you get stuck you could try to get larger but then it means that we will probably understand it but maybe I get I would have got it first before then anybody else but yeah, it's good to try to stay within the within whatever you've shared definitely that's the idea of of the code good okay.
-9.096407890319824;-16.545413970947266;1;We'll do we'll do the other way where I get I will try to make you guess gifts. okay then Sahaj you were with Romana I'm gonna send you a world do you remember when we were talking about that street in that area? Yep. Where you were and that maybe because maybe they would take something from you which would be what should be the people or the thieves
-20.166444778442383;5.2030816078186035;1;No, not thiefs.Ah God how to do this and also something that you need a lot when we were speaking about the heating money Oh your belongings, but also also that thing that belongs to Agha that thing could possibly eat it hmm, that wouldn't be good if it ate it would know but that thing that that relates to feves and money what a lot. No, but like a physical thing that AG has think could put in its hand rumour mill but it relates to money series no boy yep
-16.091581344604492;3.3430392742156982;1;Why did all my bad just well coins coin because I was trying to give it away it was very hard thing is a baby guys by the way but didn't really yeah try trying to wonder what's I guess
-16.135133743286133;3.3096845149993896;1;it just I just thought it said baby be easier to put it in mouth but if it was a thing guys wouldn't guess. Anyway there we go
18.6524715423584;-13.419185638427734;1;okay great we're done. Okay and yeah I'm gonna send you a word and you were Natalia Yeah Who's fine? Okay? Her phone died. Okay so let's kill off my partner let's keep this one for later sorry so who is that to do so I guess maybe could someone just send a world to cities so I could guess send me a wild I don't know whoever just a random words privately because we work together so if I choose the word then I get out you okay doing that oh to you to meet yeah okay oh no I think this is better because I'm I've done the exercise so it's better if I try to guess whether them just use a word generator if you don't know okay I said something Okay, um very difficult to not give it away so yeah it's very broad so your map you know when we when, when we described the first impression, yeah it was it was negative but what what negative? What kind of learning? No, put your clothes. Sad. No, sharing.
-0.6156922578811646;-8.727081298828125;1;You know that imagine what is this? This item? Let's call it that we talked about? Yeah. What does it cause? What's, what kind of fulfilling? Yes. Wow. Yeah. Great. Yes. Okay. And listening was sandwiches.
19.25203514099121;-12.348640441894531;1;So I got a feeling from this is not the way I heard the difference. I didn't hear the feeling that's why I said it's so broad everything you say it's related. It was like meaning the word. Yeah. Yeah, that's what yeah, the broader the hardest. For sure. Yeah, I was trying to not give away what we talked. So maybe people wouldn't think of the feeling of taste, you know, like or like the sense. And then maybe we could find it but okay, we ate. We responded to our mistake. So. Good. Good. Do you guys want to also try the other way around, or should we just Yeah, yeah. Okay. Let's try the other way. around so now Pietro I'm gonna send you a word. Okay, maybe I'll just try to get a word that's a bit I have some really interesting words okay? Yeah okay, okay all right okay, so you know the activity that you did today that didn't go as planned so what's the medium that was okay not with what's there then medium that is inside the device that you use glass no and my clothes What do you say film? Yeah okay it was a very good oh it was not a problem but you said medium and then I hacked your communication because I know my yes my discipline yeah that was a no my as baby nice when you said last I thought camera so it's yeah there was I was I was thinking I should tricky oh wow ridiculous this is just too good. Yeah. Yeah such a good haka he's hacking
-6.705672740936279;-13.061955451965332;1;good good well well done for trying though. Okay, so now okay. Jim. Yeah. I'm gonna send a while to you Tanya. Your iPhone right yes your mic is off
-19.47774887084961;3.7767598628997803;1;so we were talking about cuts and the hierarchy and who looks after who what role the cat has over us Oh where did this host owner close close the superior How can I extend it child thinking about that documentary you watched and how the musician used his cat I think that's a red herring though. Craig crate and row crate know kind of the hierarchy within the structure a producer like I knew the musician was retiring. Let's get backwards. Forget the documentary EAD no no Master yes, yeah well done. So your code was really efficient gets really efficient great.
-2.4387991428375244;-11.713781356811523;1;Okay, so now who is next? I could remember it was a I'm gonna I'm gonna send you an MS Word yes big one so you know the place you were last week yeah. And you said there was some problems with wanted to eat and this could maybe be a cause for it in the bigger picture poison yeah so it's more sorry water no so not the natural more coming from
-22.335140228271484;7.5998382568359375;1;pollution people virus. I need to describe it differently or maybe let's go back to the other place you know how we talked about that road and it was cutting sorry sorry just cut
-22.99340057373047;3.3723528385162354;1;Okay, so yeah, how we talked about that road and how you said from that one side road? How he changed Yeah. And whose fault isn't? Gentrification but it's not I know take over
-32.5745849609375;-4.77397346496582;1;Government industry Yeah, factory. Yeah, it's such a big word. It's just producers
-32.41059875488281;-4.664797306060791;1;have dualism Yeah, kinda commercialization that's a big word. It's more like integration
-32.7420654296875;-4.147084712982178;1;when you say Maya globalisation industrialization it's also a big word. Yeah. And that I don't know how to what else do we same market so Sherry sector huh? tertiary sector
-33.17888259887695;-4.69417667388916;1;with sector? The tertiary No, that's a big word. Okay. Yeah, it's so big so it's hard to farming
-22.932283401489258;8.305598258972168;1;maybe let's go differently so as more group of people from industrialists society society,
-2.647475481033325;-12.633623123168945;1;yeah. Ah, I was not gonna get it. conversation to personnel. We didn't talk. It's good try though. Yeah. It's a tough one. It's too big. Maybe too obvious. I don't know how to describe it. Yeah, true. How to relate such a big word to my personality. Yeah, true. But well done for train. I guess. I've sent you a word. I know. And I don't really know what to do with it.
-22.794971466064453;12.06080150604248;1;And I was a very specific words so that's
-18.07293701171875;3.9260642528533936;1;All right. Oh, maybe this you know, Eric, you said recently you went to your Sona but with with this particular person that's quite close to you but that you haven't seen for quite some time. And could you could you tell in which way you relate it to this person? Cousin but what's the way that relates you both family blood and do you share similar DNA your DNA
-22.68773078918457;5.531081199645996;1;DNA, like ticks. What is my acid versus what was this I said siblings I saw Tanya you said genetics. Yeah, I heard that. Quote. What was the what was the word? Genetic? Genetic?
-1.1196826696395874;-11.06128215789795;1;It was it was a good angle that you Yeah. Nice. So Natalia is still not back. I'm sorry. And yeah, she wants me. She said she doesn't have a charger at work. Oh, okay. Okay, maybe I get that you still have this thing? Open the word generator and then I could No, but it was
-7.021221160888672;-13.905838012695312;1;my i It's your feeling. Okay. Okay. Maybe Could you send me another feeling? Okay. Uh, huh. Yes. Should I send it to you now? Yes. Yes. So I can I can. Hard or crazy.
-27.941741943359375;9.4945068359375;1;You choose?
19.113771438598633;-10.380879402160645;1;I think like Sotiris is a great hacker, so maybe he can spy our conversation? Exactly. Maybe he knew all along is the hacker host. Okay, what can I say? Um It's a funny one. Okay. Oh, wow. All right. Um, okay, I'm gonna tie myself that's gonna be a tough one. So, you know, which I'm gonna I'm gonna so, you know, when we spoke about this this thing we went, we were doing when we were had gymnasium. Like, we kind of learned, and then I went, I went somewhere. And this this thing I went through had, like, was quite special for me. And it had something around it is just so hard. It was good. Yeah, but Plus, with that. I stick No, no, it created something so special to me that oh, yeah, I know. Okay. The again, Chris sandwich has something so specific that we spoke about, and I think that creates something really special within for that sandwich. No, and the sandwich carries something that's quite like meaningful for me. He has especially in prisons so far. Oh, yeah. I went to Geneva for this thing which to have ordered. It's quite unusual. All right. Yeah, I was really trying to fake like, we didn't speak about anything. Yeah, that was really nice. We didn't go That's amazing. Yeah, exactly. So yeah, you have the same feeling who said it was? I was thinking it before. And but then the sandwich was like it can't be or Sarah you like also the egg and Chris sandwich. Right, right. Kids? Amazing. Okay, great.
14.27670955657959;16.28780174255371;1;Well, thank you everyone for your participation and exchange. So I guess there was another path to this, but I'm just thinking we could also do it in our own time. And then. So I could like just kind of give you the steps and then do it in our own time, and then see what other people are coming up with on this. So I've created I've created this book that's called every now let me send you the link. Yeah, here we are. I think everyone can have access to it. And you should all be able to add blocks to it. You can choose file or paste the URL and image or video, is that okay, for everyone can see that? Yeah. Okay, good. So it's kind of playing on this kind of arms on encryption is going further with that, and trying to actually produce something with this. And so I've been looking a lot at, I have this great document from the poetry school. And because a programme that's called Magic and computer programming. And so there is a good text about the computing languages. So computing languages are created in order to create certain kind of action or manipulation of other codes in bracket data. In this sense, perhaps software is always an already poetic, it is a precise description, precise description, and pure syntax, the signifier and signified clearly concede in the machine. So I think that's resonate quite well with what we just did the receiver and, and the sender and the language, we kind of created the abstract language and codes that we created through our intimate sharing. And I can give you actually, this website, also that I find quite magical. That's number one.
-21.661331176757812;19.41533851623535;1;So the idea is going to is going to be to create, why is it sometimes it's so strange resume, it's going to be to create a poem. So I'll give you a structure for it. So with the free words that you've initially written, in the first exercise, the kind of meditation exercise, I asked you to write three words down, so please reuse them in one of these platform I'm about to send you. So just type those three words in, ah, why is it? Yes, here we are. So you have, we you have five platforms I've just sent you. So if you just choose one, and tie those three worlds within that platform, so it's either the AI generating story, so a bit what I get I was using for the transcript, I guess, your emails, Reddit chats, Google Translate, or eBay. So if you just type those three worlds within whatever platform you're using, and then click on Enter, and then that will generate something. If you click right on this page that is generated, and then you click on view page source, that will give you the coding for the page. So then second step, so I'll just write it down there there.
-19.245933532714844;20.491743087768555;1;Yeah, um, then if you take part of the code that is given to you, and again, process it into this AI this morning. What You guys. So yeah, it's like, it's text to image machine learning. But it's really like it's a free machine learning, and it's really bad. It has a lot of pictures of dogs and printers you will see. So just use part of this code and part of the code you've generated and paste it into the deep AI takes image generator, then that will of course, give you generate an image. And from that image, I'm asking you to write a small poem of five sentences maximum about this image that is being generated. And how, how do we view page source?
-22.029067993164062;21.549379348754883;1;Yes, if you click right, on the page, yeah. And it's called View Page Source. Can you see that? Okay, yeah, cool, huh? Okay, good. So you can say, Yes, part of the code, you don't have to copy all the code, because it's going to be quite long. But some of it may be something that you find quite interesting in terms of the way it looks. 
-19.13091468811035;19.765869140625;1;And so yes, so from that image, please write a poem about that image. And that has to be five sentence sentences max. And within that poem, again, another constraint, you will have to use one of the word that's in that's in the codes, and one of the words that you initially used. So I'm just gonna write it down again. So you guys applaud the instruction. So use the image generated from deep AI and write a poem, five syntaxes Max about the image you are using. And in this poem, you need to include one word, which is part of the code that you have found in one word that was sorry, I made a mistake, actually, one word, one initial word that you you created, you you came up with, and then upload your image and your poem on arena, maybe you want to like, yeah, if you can make them one file, so it can either be next to each other, or maybe on top of each other. Kind of similar to what this website, the poetry, the code poetry website I gave you. I mean, that's quite interactive, because the poem appears as a code. But maybe just think about, yeah, the layering of the text and the image. I don't know if that was clear. It's like lots of instruction. But it's like, like just encrypting more and more and more and more.
-21.652385711669922;21.872394561767578;1;I think I'm a little bit stuck on the, you know, when you have view page source, and then is like, sorry, let me just see that text encoding, is that the one? No, if you do view page shows, normally, there should be another another window that appears with the code for the page, like it's just, it's just lots of lines of codes. Let me share my screen rocketry. Lea, I got four images and not just one. You have four images. Yeah. Oh, interesting. I'm not getting any it says ever. Source. So that's so let's say I'm here. Yeah, the poetry scholar athletes, right? View Page Source should give you okay, this line of code like okay, okay, a code. And then let's say I quit like this. Like Well, function, ABC function ADC. Okay, I'm taking this
-20.03238296508789;13.15668773651123;1;To to this here. What's happened? Now you have to click Submit Sarah maybe that's why you had those four images I don't know who said effort to Sarah who said that
-5.889486312866211;-10.26485824584961;1;was me and I got four. Ah, oh, this is like a template. Okay.
17.220197677612305;-12.2991304397583;1;It's a bit I don't know why it's taking so long. Maybe lots of people are using it. Normally, it should actually equate or maybe it's just doesn't like it. Ah, so maybe it's we need to only take one one minute Have you ever? Yeah, okay. Yeah, he doesn't like the code. I just put one word. Yeah, maybe. Yeah, one words. I tried to have one word and also gives me an error. Okay. Yeah, I think the system is done. No, it's not. Oh, yeah. and narrow. Yeah, I think there is an issue. Oh, no, I hope it's still free this thing. Maybe now you have to pay and that's the only thing I found for image to text image to text. Generator because open AI is actually you have to pay for it. Okay, maybe it's just maybe it's just dumb for. Image to text AI? Know, I'm so sad. This is bad. I used it not that long ago. I used it like okay, well, maybe we just keep that I don't know, we just do another text. Let's see. What do you do with this code? Poetry link? Bark? No, no, it's just to have some visuals, ideas of like, where my inspiration is coming from. It's now I think this this is not working anymore. 
-19.599225997924805;19.745281219482422;1;Okay, well can we skip this step? So we can skip this step? Or if not, we could just instead use this one, which is the text text generating. So maybe that's another kind of step to include within your poem is to have. So if you just type your line of code in this text generation, because this seems to be working somehow, then that will generate another block of words. Yeah, and that might be that might be the visuals actually. I don't know. No, that doesn't work. Okay, let's, let's just keep that step in. So no image, but then what do you write a poem about? But why don't we find can we not find an image through some text that we got already in the deep story AI? And then answer it as like just google images and get the first image that appears or something? Because then we've already used AI somewhere. So it kind of works. I think it works now.
-25.70697784423828;-1.5033519268035889;1;Something another one. I have a dog. Yeah. Thank you works. It was nice.
-24.94790267944336;3.939470052719116;1;Okay, it's back. It's back on. Hey, so you will see probably lots of people have dog dogs images. With dogs have a dog. Yeah. And if you keep on submitting, you'll see the dog.
-5.838418960571289;-10.016913414001465;1;I found another one. Really weird. Okay. This is quite fun. Oh, this like a monster with pants on. I'll send you a link it takes a bit of time though. It took like three minutes.
-23.275806427001953;1.6814814805984497;1;Okay to generate. I guess you could either use what's nice? No, I send it just to you. Sorry.
-18.58785629272461;19.360031127929688;1;So I guess you guys could choose to either use this one or the deep AI one. It's up to you. As long as you have an image that generate that is generated from that code and And yeah, five sometimes is max. So then that doesn't take so long for you to. I don't know if we should like set ourselves a time timeframe, but maybe could be nice to have everything uploaded. Tonight. If you guys have time we could do it. Should we just do it now? That sentences
0.3420654535293579;-11.366689682006836;1;if you want, it's up to you. Because we have 15 minutes to Yeah. Okay okay, are you up for doing it now?Do we need to sign up for the marina? Yeah, you shouldn't do you? You shouldn't have to. I think you can. Okay yeah, I'm already signed in. That's what yeah, maybe you do have to sign up. Although I must say it's a great it's a great platform. Yeah, sign up and the one I sent you need to click update there was I don't see any. Okay, so maybe Yeah, our constraint is to do it within the next 15 minutes. And then it's nice to see the result.
-22.902095794677734;18.382051467895508;1;Okay. So we generate an image and then write a few words, I will serve see
-22.40134048461914;19.085866928100586;1;five sentences. And we upload images and sentences to the array. Exactly. And in your five sentences, you should have one word that's in the code and words that you use initially. But you tell me again, how to get that link thing. You know, the first step I count the right click which option wasn't yet it's right click View, Page Source. Page Source. Okay, thank you.
-19.406288146972656;18.18122673034668;1;But these a lot of words or just save one or two? In your sentences on in the image generation, image generation, I think it's better to just use the like just one or two. Okay. If not, it will really give you some random things. Or an error. Oh naira. Do you have a narrative? Yes, but I think it was just too complicated.Do we need to log into this website
-22.96678924560547;15.424378395080566;1;in the arena? I know the deep AI No, you shouldn't have to if you just click on submit submit is quite small. But just follow the link because if you do deep AI on Google then it will give you something else. That's the link did you do that? And then it's asking you to

-25.520742416381836;5.291935443878174;1;What do you mean you made a small sentence like just a huge sentence but
-22.103076934814453;15.884011268615723;1;it's fine. Yeah. You had up to five sentences. That was fine I'm having issue myself with the deep AI thing. So maybe I'm still waiting for my image. Yeah, me too. Errors.
-19.224143981933594;17.425758361816406;1;Maybe it's because I'm here. Too many people are using it. I don't know. I guess for whoever hasn't been able to do it. We can upload it as long as we upload it. Maybe tonight. That's fine. If I think they want it Pietro just sent worked. Yes. Yes. It's just it's funny because I was writing the dog is not a bird and then someone actually uploaded an image of a bird.
-20.781538009643555;16.373538970947266;1;Not to the image of the belt. I'm the image of the dog. No way. I was funny. But my first word that I thought was birds. That's why I wrote the dog is not a bird. Bird next. There is the first word you wrote in the first exercise. Yeah, it's words like birds out my window, but I don't think it came into the Zoom call. Yeah, no, I couldn't hear any blocks everything.
-27.843713760375977;3.03114652633667;1;I heard I heard birds or you did not cool. Can you hear me? chopping wood by the way? YES.
-7.0942063331604;4.657777309417725;2;I'm good. Okay. Hi, David. I'm Sarah Rodrigues. I'm from Portugal. I lived in London many years. That's where I met these these two ladies that invited this for this project. And I'm now back in Portugal and living in the countryside. And I have an interdisciplinary practise as an artist, which is becoming more and more ingrained with the land and kind of ideas of of sustainability and autonomy and co-dependency with our habitats that we live in kind of thing. So that's. So interesting.Yes. I'm really having a it's it's a great time to live. And it's a it's an oak it's near an oak forest. So it's wow. It's quite wow. But I'm not there at the moment, actually. Just in. I'm looking forward to your presentation and thank you for taking the time. 
-6.0211358070373535;3.864095449447632;2;Thanks for coming. Hey. I'm Eric. And can you hear me? Yes, Eric. Yeah. Loud and clear. Hello. From Helsinki. And it's very nice. Clear. Friday night outside, I'm developing the digital platform for this project, which is going to be online. Yeah. And yeah. Looking forward to your presentation. Fabulous.  Hi there. Hi, David. Amelia Lee. Actually, I'm based in Paris. And so speaking from Paris and also between Paris and Lille, which is the north of France, that's where I live at the moment. And I was in London for 13 years or so. That's where I kind of got to know all of those people. And yeah, I also have like multidisciplinary practises. I walk between performances, I do some teaching filmmaking installation and I'm trying to kind of formulate ideas around technology and ethics and technologies and bodies. I mean, it's quite broad, but yeah, that's, that's what I do. 
-5.274416446685791;2.8941123485565186;2;Right? Thank you. She's. Hi, I'm Ramona and I'm based in London at the moment. Artist and teacher. Yeah, I work with photography and. Materials here. Nice to see you. Good to meet you. Thank you. Hi, David. Clash. Yeah. Okay, I'll go. Yeah. Nice to meet you. I'm Peter. I'm based in London normally, but now I'm in Italy for Easter. Right. My practise is mainly sound based. And between sound and programming. Sound and age. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, absolutely. And is the threshold between sound and. XLE Digital. Yeah, I know that feeling about being on thresholds. I mean, it's. That's everybody. No, I'm quite.  Hi, I'm Rachel Canadian, but now based in London. And I work a lot in sculpture but also have a background in tech and augmented reality. And you know, primary focus of my work is looking at archaeological practises and the the ways that sort of historic narratives are constructed over time.
-6.876864910125732;2.5161218643188477;2;Yeah. Mm hmm. Thank you. Nice to see you. Hi, my name is Matt Wallace, and I believe that I'm based in London and I guess that's how I met the girls as well, because they were studying together at the Royal College of Art. Oh yeah, I'm currently actually in Morocco, but yeah, I guess I'm an artist, interdisciplinary as well, and I work quite a lot with photography and object making with what? So advanced photography and sculpture, object making. 
-6.552177429199219;5.312854290008545;2;And so I'm Jamaican. Yeah, that's right.  Yeah. Nice. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. This. Hi, my name is Ada and now based in London. That's how I met a cat, Anya. And from the time of studying the whole time. But you're studying RSA as well, and you didn't really get to know each other till after that. And a sound, eventing, eclectic, sound venue in London. And, and I'm originally from China and I was always performance and currently I'm doing research mentally using fiction as method and them you're working with virtual improvisation. They're using telepresence to explore the kind of connexion, this connexion with the vision and body moment through telematics. 
1.640690565109253;0.8140316009521484;2;Telematics. Maybe you'll be interested in the workshop that I'm hoping to. Present today which is allows the body and. Some sort of mind full body. Yeah. Looking forward to it. Mm hmm. Yes. I think that's everyone, right? That's everyone. Okay. So, okay, so let's do all of you kind of know each other then. They're all quite familiar with each other. Yes and no. Yes. No. Right.  It's. Many of us know each other in different configurations, I think. With some people, I think we know each other very well with some less. But I think with everyone there is some sort of link. 
-20.03505516052246;1.3762609958648682;2;Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm. Hmm hmm hmm. Okay. Right. So the Royal College of Art isn't. Not everyone is from the Royal College of Arts or. No, no, no, no. Right. Okay. So should I. Should I just stop. Stop talking. Yes, please. So, first of all, I have to say thank you. Oh, hi to everyone. And thank you very much for inviting me along today. So I'm going to. I'm obviously going to be using my computer to communicate with you if you in the background. If there's a if you hear a voice droning on in the background, it's probably my screen reader. It's annoying. Do tell me because I can turn it off. I think I can turn it down for you, but not for me. So just let me hear anything. You haven't heard anything. I'm all good, okay? Just let me know. It's a problem. 
-9.473136901855469;-7.730231761932373;2;I think it's. It's not audible for us. That's good, because sometimes I think it is. It depends on the sort of settings, but. Yeah. So, yeah. So. Hi everyone. So my name's David Johnson and I am a practising artist. I. I'm studying at the moment at the Royal College of Arts in London, and I'm a Ph.D. candidate and I'm about half way or maybe just over halfway through my through my PhD, the. And my practise is kind of a shifting thing, but. I know what I'm planning to do, just to let you know the sort of overall plan. And you're and I got to know it, but I'm just going to talk for a little bit about myself. I hope it's not too tedious for you, but just to give you the background to where I'm coming from and where blindness sits in my practise and in my life. And I'm going to talk a little bit about my research, but not too much. And then I'm going to talk a little bit about my art. And then after about 20 minutes or so,
-5.03989839553833;-0.4180212616920471;2;I'll start the workshop, which is sort of loosely, loosely organised, and it'll be around a sort of very much a shared workshop and it's more about thinking and feeling rather than meeting today. We're not going to be making anything. So if anyone feels like making or drawing or doing anything they wish, then obviously that's entirely up to you. But I'm going to be turning our minds, as it were, initially anyway, inwards in in upon ourselves and then hopefully outwards again. So that's the idea. So that's the overall plan. So yeah. So to go back to sort of me. 
-12.677274703979492;-4.261589527130127;2;I. I'm a I'm a blind person. I'm totally blind. I've got a an eye condition known as retinitis pigmentosa. And that's a hereditary condition, which. People who have this condition, typically they start off life with good vision and then the vision gradually goes over time. Now, with some people, it goes very slowly. And in fact, with some people, they still retain useful vision all their lives with some people they go by and very quickly. And I'm sort of in the middle of somewhere. I, I was diagnosed with this condition when I was 15 because I was beginning to show signs of not seeing well, particularly in the dark night. So my parents took me to an eye specialist and they diagnosed it as this this condition, retinitis pigmentosa or P as it's known for short. It's quite a common sight. I think it's the most common cause of blindness in younger people, even though I'm not young now. But when when I was diagnosed in my teens, they said, well, I would have useful vision until my midlife, whatever that means. And sure enough, I was in my mid-thirties when I lost my sight completely. 35, 36, something like that. So they were about right.
-11.189332962036133;-5.807453155517578;2;You know, I'm now in my mid-sixties, by the way, so I'm an older person and I've gone back to college just as a as an older person. So I started off life as an artist. Actually, art was something very, very important to my life as a child and as a teenager, I did a lot of painting and drawing. It was a big part of my life. And in fact, at that stage, I always planned to go to college and try and develop as an artist. In fact, I did go to college for a year. Before my eyesight started to really deteriorate quite quickly. And at that time, I was in my late teens and I thought, well, maybe art isn't something I can do. So I looked elsewhere for a direction, and I chose music because I'd been doing music in a sort of secondary capacity for a few years. But at that stage, I decided to swap my interests from art to music. What I didn't realise at that young age was that actually because I thought art was something you needed to isolate in order to do. In my thirties when I. Lost my sight completely. I started to. Regain an interest in art for two reasons. I started to go to audio description, events and indeed workshops, a bit like the one we're doing today. You said they were making workshops. These events were designed for blind people or visually impaired people. And I started to do these events. Go to these events at galleries and workshops. And occasionally artist studios began to enjoy making things again, or at least thinking about art again in a very sort of definite way. And.
-10.18418025970459;-4.839256286621094;2;So doing these workshops is very important and also audio description events. This is where the museums and galleries, they organise events where. Articulate people to describe for visually impaired people the art that's being exhibited. And I found that is very exciting because I realised at that point that vision was coming back to me. I was seeing the paintings and sculptures that were being described in my mind's eye in a very powerful way. The colours, the shapes, the the visual experience of art was still with me, even though I was optically blind, totally blind. And that was such a thrilling sort of experience to regain vision in that way. A through description. So it sort of energised me into sort of doing more of these audio description events and getting more involved with art.
-10.7034912109375;-7.093817234039307;2;So in, in my mid thirties, through to my thoughts into my forties, I started to develop again, I think some sort of decent art practise having left it sort of 15 years. Earlier. And I started working in 3D, I started using actually a little bit of plaster and concrete. Those were my go to go to materials. And I started to make things. I started to cast and I started to to mould, make moulds and use a lot of ready made. Premade objects and put them together was things that I'd made. I'm just experimenting in a very untutored way. And. In that sort of broadly sculptural area. So I got more and more interested in this and it developed over the over the years until, you know, here I am now sort of studying, studying back at college and with a research interest in the very thing that ironically brought me back to back to art. And that is blindness. So my hope. Now, perhaps before I show you bits of my art, I'll perhaps talk maybe the wrong way around. But I'll talk a little bit about my research as I've as I've mentioned it. So my. Yeah. My, my research college is looking at basically two things, looking at artmaking, but also looking at disability or blindness. And I'm interested in the relationship between blindness and making art. And again, I suppose part of what started that interest was I was working before I came to college, after working at a certain galleries, helping them develop workshops for visually impaired visitors. 
-11.823807716369629;-6.349098205566406;2;So I was beginning to work with other blind people on art, making it usually in response to exhibitions that I've been put on. So I did quite a lot of work with the Royal Academy in London and they had some fantastic exhibitions and we, we, we designed workshops for blind people based on the exhibitions that were happening at the time. So we always had that sort of thematic. Starting point. So I got to work with a lot of other visually impaired people making art. And it dawned on me, well, two things. Cancer too. I came to realise to two things. One was that in fact visual impairment is an incredibly complicated subject. You know, blind, you know, the word blind or visually impaired just doesn't do justice to the complexity of, of the phenomenon of, of, of visual impairment. There's lots of I mean, you may be, you know, all this, but there are lots of different types of blindness. There are lots of different diseases and reasons why people lose their signs and how they lose their sight and the the speed or the duration of sight loss. Some people, you know, obviously lose it very quickly. And that's a very different experience to people who lose it very slowly, which is my my experience. With losing eyesight quickly. It's obviously much more of a trauma than losing your sight slowly. And. With a slow, slight loss. Like in my own experience, it's such a gradual process that somehow the visual experience, the real, you know, the light, the experience of light is still with you for many, many years. And it sort of just gradually sort of fades over over decades in some cases. And that's a very different experience to someone who loses it overnight, you know, with a. Some kind of trauma. And I met people from all different of these workshops. I met people from all different stages of blindness. And they were all almost all of them were very keen to talk about the journey they were having with that blindness. So obviously it's a very important part of their lives. And it sort of was, you know, something that they were very keen to tell you about and explain their personal story and their personal experiences. And, you know, again, it dawned on me how complex of the world that world is, you know, and, you know, it depends on where you are in your own life in terms of your life. Sort of story. 
-11.917116165161133;-5.371054649353027;2;If you're a young person or an older person, when your side goes, a lot of older people lose that vision, either partially or completely. Blindness or visual impairment tends to be in older persons saying, you know, most registered blind people are older people. So that was the sort of starting point for my research, really close encounters with other blind people and that realisation on my part. So you've got a complexity on the subject. The other thing that dawned on me as I was doing this workshops was the way that blind people can make art. It seems ironic and somehow wrong that. Visual art, as it's so often called, should still be available to blind people. But these workshops were enthusiastically taken up by blind people that were very keen. Generally speaking, not all of them, but then not all sighted. People want to do art, want to make things, do they? But the majority of visitors to these workshops were keen to get involved and are very interested in art. They're very interested in the exhibitions that were the workshops were attached to. They wanted to know about art and what. All the fuss was about, I suppose. 
-13.088658332824707;-11.552441596984863;2;So I got very interested in that whole world and I ended up at college. So what I'll do now is I'll just read for you. That was just a short sort of abstract from a paper that I presented a few weeks ago, actually, at a college event. So I'm just going to give you an overview of where my research is and where it hopes to go. So I'll just find that. Just bear with me. Just, you know, just finding it now. So there you go. So I just find that some of the files I spoke to tended to let me go. So. So can you. Can you hear my voice and my screen reader at all? 
-14.070267677307129;-6.205439567565918;2;Yes, a little bit.  Okay. But it's not. You can hear me over it. Yes. Yes, of course. Okay. So I'll start reading anyway. Sorry. It's a bit sort of coherent, but it's not too bad. Blind aesthetics art as the currency of the invisible. That's the title of my research as it is at the moment. I'll say it again. Blind aesthetics art as the currency of the invisible. So blindness is a mode of being rather than just a mode of disability. That's a sort of opening statement. Blindness as a mode of being rather than just as a mode of disability. The supporting research for this paper characterises blindness as a way of life that is both particular and peculiar and with its own expressive language. This language is expressive of the positive and generative aspects of blindness, rather than just expressive of the striving to overcome the impediments that blindness undoubtedly presents in our contemporary and increasingly ocular centric society. As such, this research is premised on notions of disability gain and blindness, assault, disability and notions of disability gain and blindness gain that amplify and build on the work of key writers such as Georgina Kluge and Hannah Thomson. So blindness as a category and as a subset of disability covers a large and complex range of medical conditions, as well as psychological, social and experiential ontologies, all of which are inadequately and only partially understood at the moment. 
-28.719764709472656;5.833220958709717;2;This paper addresses some of these shortcomings and does so from the perspective of art, practise and aesthetics, and the lived experience of the artist's author's own acquired total blindness. The pivotal concepts or critical discontents that underpinned this paper and its supporting research are threefold. Firstly, the disabled able bodied binary following David thought disability is here thought of as a continuum that we all inhabit. Rather than the othering and polarising binary culture that currently persists. 
-13.572322845458984;-5.31350040435791;2;Secondly, following Jacques Derrida, this chirality is thought of as an innate human modality called an omnibus and a necessary. Dependent more on neurological, psychological and societal health rather than optical. And thirdly, visual art and visual art practise is thought of as a series of cuts or interruptions or commerce that have little or nothing to do with healthy eyesight. So by adopting these critical apexes of thought, as I call them, this paper will argue that blindness has an identifiable and unified contribution to make to both contemporary art practise and, by extension, to the wider society. I have not made some sort of sense. I'm trying to tackle. The relationship between blindness and artmaking. By means of a few key concepts. Chief amongst them, this thing called an omniscience, which is like a sort of deep memory or a kind of deep innate knowledge that we all have, blind or otherwise. We've all got that concept and the concept of the coma, which is like a break or a stilling or a moment of. Tension or relaxation between things.
-12.990870475769043;-12.604936599731445;2;So now I'll just. I'll just. I think I'll just show you some. I'll just show you some of my pieces. I've got some small pieces. I've got a couple of images I want to share with you, which I hope. And I guess I can show in a minute. I'll start. Yeah, I'll just start off. So I'll start off by. Yeah. I'll start off by showing you a couple of things. So I use. Actually, before I came to college, the RCA, I was using 3-D printing a little bit in what I was doing, but since being at college, I've used it a lot more. And I've used it in one particular project, which is quite old now, but I made a piece called Transient Objects caught in a multi dimensional moment of impossible Pringles. What's the title of that piece? But this piece is all about touch, really, and about the the experience of touching something, an object, usually a familiar object. As a blind person, it dawned on me that. With with blindness. And I'm sure it's true of everyone when you touch something that's very familiar to you. You don't need to touch it very much at all before you recognise and understand what it is. 
-18.136722564697266;-10.014837265014648;2;This truism doesn't really occur to you. I don't think it's a sighted person. It certainly did to me when I was sighted because you generally speaking, you look at what you're going to touch before you touch it. So you identify it by science with blindness. Of course you can't do that. So you're identifying things by touch. And it dawned on me as a blind person that that moment of recognition is very, very quick with very familiar objects. So you only have to place your fingertips on something and you know instantly what it is because of the familiar shape of the familiar temperature or the familiar texture or all three of those things. So this piece is based on that phenomenon and this. So I'm just going to hold it here. This is one example of it. This is what I call a transient object. So they say they based. 
-19.20845603942871;-7.349900722503662;2;Gave it higher. And higher, yet perfect to set up so that I'm just going to spin it round. This is a 3D print. Object says plastic. The material is plastic. I can't remember what colour it is. Is it sort of creamy colour? His. Why? Why? Can you see what it might be? Sort of cap. Yeah. And Doug? Yes. Sorry. A little Doug over a cup? Yes. It's actually a coffee. A standard coffee cup. But what I've tried to do, and me and the technicians in the rapid forms, we try to isolate the points of touch the fingertips. So on here, we've just got these areas where the fingers are light on the cup. So there's one there. Unless there's one there. There's one. There was one there, the four fingers on that side, then the thumb on the other side should be a some. Sorry. Can you see that? 
-19.402835845947266;-9.89059066772461;2;And then the handle itself is marked out by. Over the points of touch. The points of touch on the handle your fingers. So it's when I hold when I put my fingers on those. What I call Pringles. Just a little oval shaped things. The whole experience of the mug comes to me as if I'm holding a proper mug, you know, rather than a skeleton of a mug. So as a blind person, this feels as if I'm holding a mug. And in fact, I'm now saying you shouldn't tip it up unless I spill my coffee. So. I was just trying to capture that moment of touch by my fingertips. And that's what gives it to the shape. The shape is in the fingertips. 
-19.327144622802734;-7.108170986175537;2;Only, you know. So what you're left with is this very skeletal shape of the, of the, of the mark, which a couple of you recognised it from the skeletal shape. Maybe, maybe this handle here gave it away more than anything because yeah, there's a lot of fingers gathered together on that handle and so there's a lot of material. On that passes the whole shape, whereas the body as a mark hasn't got many fingertips, so it's much more implied rather than shown. So this this idea sort of quite interested to me and I've developed that further. So here's another piece. This is a. This is a similar idea, but I've taken a. Well, maybe again, maybe you can identify it from what little evidence there is on hold. It can say that. Yes, but they dropped in again. This is a 3D print. Does it suggest anything too visually typical? Yeah. 
-17.150102615356445;-15.513680458068848;2;Uh, there's a door. Sorry.  So there's this really large area of support right there. Right. The curved area. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  I was going to say a door handle, but prevention. Yeah. Yeah. It's actually essentially a pair of the fruit because. And all it is is it's a hands holding up her hand, but it's just the points of touch. So again, I've recorded in 3D print the finger tips at the top. This one. Sorry. Can you see this? There's one there. There's one there. There's one there. And these sort of Pringle shapes. Overall. And then I think the big area there is the palm of the hand holding the phone again, if you put your fingers around it like I'm doing there. It feels like I've got a real power in my hands because. It's all the points of touch are connected to my hand, and that's all I would have anyway if I was holding a pair of pair in my hand. So I've just isolated the points of touch, which obviously don't suggest the whole pair very clearly to you, because you couldn't, you couldn't really recognise it, could it? So that's another example of the transient objects. 
-16.009170532226562;-9.325029373168945;2;The transient is interesting in my mind anyway, because it's as if the power is there when I'm holding it and then it disappears. When I release it, because as one person, you can't just look at it to check. It's still there. It just feels as if it disappears from the world because. I'm holding it with my other hand so that illusion doesn't work. But normally if I put it down, it's just a memory. Now it's just I can't just look at it and check that it's still there. So that's very much a transient experience of touching. So again, this is part of. What I try and. Try and identify or isolate with the idea of blind aesthetics, the aesthetics and the experiences that are particular. Two blindness. 
-16.740488052368164;-10.640268325805664;2;It's David. Because when we look at the pair, we we are not we aren't thinking of touch normally or we don't hold it in our memory so much the where we would touch that pair. Yeah. So it's like we're just, we're just trained visually in a very kind of two dimensional way, not with the, the, the memory is not paired with the feeling memory as such like we don't have that knowledge is often. 
-17.657346725463867;-16.020448684692383;2;As you say, we don't touch we're even told as children often not to touch. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, maybe that's sometimes that's sensible but. Especially in visual as well. Sorry. Especially with fine arts as well. Right. This idea of. Yeah. Don't touch in galleries. Oh my goodness. That's, that's a battle I fighting a lot. Yeah. In fact, it's quite interesting about as it's just an anecdote. I went to an exhibition a couple of years ago now at the Royal Academy of Art in London by Antony Gormley, the sculptor. And it was a very popular exhibition because he was a very famous artist. And when I went in, I was with my brother and I asked, as I always do, how many of these sculptures can I touch? And I said, You can't touch any of them, I'm afraid, in the hands of all of them. 
-17.995935440063477;-15.686711311340332;2;So we went in a bit, sort of disappointed. But my brother said, Oh, nobody's looking. And just sneak a quick touch to this one. So I you know, I touched it and he looked around and he said, actually, everybody here is touching everything. All the the public is just touching everything. And I think, you know, the attendance won't stopping people either. So everybody wants to touch. And really, you know, obviously, sculpture is about touching and it's it's a contradiction, really not to touch that. Barbara had was sent to Tom. You don't understand my sculptures unless you do touch them. You've got to touch them. So, yeah, the injunction not to touch is, is a it's crazy. So. Ah, so maybe. Yeah, maybe. At this point, I could ask, uh. I wanted to show one of the images I wanted to share. This is of a much more ocean. 
-17.849245071411133;-4.877904415130615;2;Which one would you like? Can you show again the past pattern of becoming a bit of a theme in my life? This is the two as. Okay. Okay. I think everyone is being depressed now. And you say that. So this is a this is a sculpture I did last year and exhibited it last November in London at the OXO Gallery. And this I hope this picture is of these two enormous as on show sitting together in the gallery. So this is where I've. It's just not what it is about touch, but it's more about scale as well. Obviously, the powers have been exploded up to a scale far beyond their natural, natural scale. And this was done, again, purely by technology. We scanned on an ordinary pair, a conference, and I've got one. I think this is a mini version of what you're seeing on the screen. I just find it so sad. And you see that? 
-17.58371353149414;-10.046591758728027;2;Yes.Yeah. So that's an exact replica of a real pair. I'll just turn it around that way because. So hopefully you can see that. So that's an exact replica of a real conference pair. That's the type of terrorist. And we scanned this thing and then we blew it. The data was was scaled up many, many, many times. So we produced an algorithm that could cut a pair of exactly the same shape out of polystyrene. And so what you see on the on the image there and we made two of them. So the piece is called a pair of pear shaped pairs. And it's just really an experiment in scale. The difference that scale makes to. Our experience of touching. When you touch these papers, you don't as a blind person, you obviously you've lost that immediate sort of knowledge because the scale has taken it out of your your experience. You know, we've never we've never experienced as of that, this size. So as a blind person, you wouldn't recognise these by touch in the way that you recognise a normal sized person. 
-17.111988067626953;-9.254339218139648;2;So I was interested in breaking that, that a knowledge for, for a blind visitor that this is more about putting. Two things together that are exactly the same. They're numerically different, but they are identical in shape because they've barriers been cut out of polystyrene by a machine following an algorithm. And the machine made the whole thing apart from the last the final stage where myself and an assistant glued the bits together to make the final shapes and then painted them. They were covered with a kind of plaster finish and then we painted them to give this texture. Which is very unpaid, like take storage. And it's to sort of deny the the smooth skin of what's fair is that Natalia has just. Joined. And. So and the other thing about this quickly, about this shelter is the two pairs don't touch each other. It's really important in my mind that they don't touch. 
-17.162832260131836;-8.507158279418945;2;There's a tiny gap between them, about three or four centimetres between these two pairs. And it's as if that gap to me is really important, particularly if you're sort of sealing these pairs, which you're encouraged to do, and in the gallery you encourage to touch them. It gives you a sense of, you know, very close proximity to each other, but they're not touching. And that, again, is a vital sort of element in a sort of blind aesthetic of not quite touching. So the reason I said earlier, which is when you don't. When you release something from touch, it disappears from your world. It's just a memory. So it's again, playing with that idea of touching or not quite touching. Okay. So the other image. Something that I wanted to share with you is against art. To do so you show the other. 
-17.792949676513672;-0.17179884016513824;2;Yes. This trip? Yes.Yeah. This is a work in progress. This is something I'm working on at the moment, which is, as it's called, you've probably come across this thing called a moebius strip. Where in know that's movie a strip is, as you probably know, a ribbon that's secured sometimes two thirds. And you still see it on the screen. Yes. I mean, the surface of a moebius strip twists. So that what was the outer surface becomes the inner substance and then it twists back again. So the surface is. Swope from NASA outside. What I've done with this, I've just used I put Braille on the surface of this strip. This this sort of prototype is made from acetate plus acetate. And and we've put Braille on one surface. So the Braille then twists fluids about this strip and becomes the inner surface and therefore in a less easy to read. So, again, it's a comic book, and my plan is to make this in a ceramic in clay and ceramics and hopefully glaze it and fire it so as to make a little clay object that can be held and touched and. Enjoyed for this shifting surface. 
-15.101468086242676;-7.287392616271973;2;The idea of the surface shifting is something that's very much part of, again, of the blind experience where Surface says, I'll talk about this a bit later surfaces. You have sort of a different identity with blindness because we don't have shut blind. People don't have shadows in their lives. Shadows of what delineates. A shape or a surface from being above or below or in shadow or out of shadow when the shadow doesn't. Isn't part of your experience, then the surface becomes a bit more unified. So this piece is about that shifting surface and ambiguity of the surface. So that. Is all that I want to say about it. They are my aunts, I think, and that's as any questions at this point. We should be quite should be quite good, actually, if anyone's got any comments on the sorts of questions at this point that this might go. I know we're planning to have a chat at the end of things as well, but. 
-6.994997978210449;-3.777585506439209;2;I just have one. It's like more information. Question So you are actually using those pieces as research pieces for your PhD. Are you testing them on people or is it mainly coming from your experience? Good question. Yeah. I started out actually thinking that I should like I should do that. But as it's developed, I've been moved away from that and I'm using my period is what I call practise led. You know, it's just. Yeah. So, so it's the art itself. So it's supposed to be making the argument, not necessarily testing it on other people. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. So it's not like you're collecting data. Yeah. Okay. No, I. I sympathise instead away from that, about two years ago now I was going down that road, she said, no, you don't need to do that. This is about this project is about your art and your art has got to make the argument. 
-7.29400634765625;-3.9292826652526855;2;Yeah, exactly. To a blind aesthetic, you know, whether that was good advice or not.  Right. That makes sense.  Yeah, it's. Yeah, it's art live. Not, not, not people at all. Well, it's about people, but it's art is the I would say art is the method. But again, I'm contradicted in that. But anyway, that's. That's a sort of a bone of contention a little bit. Hmm. So. Yeah, the. So the artists got to make the argument.  Mm hmm. And you said you were going to do you were doing lots of workshops at the Royal Academy. Are the link to you do research or. 
-13.351324081420898;-4.813390731811523;2;Do. You find. Only indirectly? Really, as I said at the beginning, my experience there was very important to my research now. But I only cited at the moment as a sort of secondary, secondary element for the same reason really, because what you're just saying about the art, the arts is. That was, you know, the the workshops that I used to be involved in and still am. Well, to lockdown anyway were very important part of my journey. But in terms of making my argument, I think the complexity side of things that I was talking about earlier is I'm using complexity or what I call heterogeneity, and that's as I'm using it in my sort of thesis argument, this, this blight aesthetic idea which comes from those workshops and the complexity that I learnt about through those workshops that. That's. That's the only way I'm bringing them in. 
-18.817508697509766;-12.877439498901367;2;Okay, that makes sense. Thank you. Okay. So this is nothing else that people want to say. I can now. On your accent. Perhaps I can introduce. There's this idea, this workshop idea, which is very much linked to what I've been saying about my art, actually, and I've been talking a lot, but I guess I'll have to. I've called a workshop. Mind for the Mind for body. And it's really very strongly linked to the trends in culture. So it dawned on me a while ago, so it's what I was doing with the transient objects, with the recording. Those points of touch is true of our body when we are well, particularly when we're just sitting in a relaxed state sort of situation. If you think about your. Your body and your experience of it at any time, at any time, in any place. And if you if you sort of think non visually, then the experience of your body is to do with touch or to do its haptics and maybe sound as well. 
-20.10054588317871;-12.561710357666016;2;But I think the haptic touch a much stronger part of your phenomenology or the experience of your own body at any time, at any place. But it's quite interesting when you're sitting on things sitting down like you are now, I presume, all of you, I'm certainly sitting to this. There are certain points of touch that your body is having with other things. And it's that. It's that. Sort of offering a statement really that is the basis of this workshop. So when I was thinking about that couple of years ago, I thought it would be great if I could make it make a sculpture like, say, the monk as a pair. But the whole body, I call it the mindful body. 
-21.20416259765625;-11.195554733276367;2;So instead of points of touch on a mug, I try and capture the points of touch that a body has with. The outside world. So, for instance, you can either. Think about your. Your the what? What you're sitting on at the moment. I'm sitting on a seat on my backside and my offices are in close, very close contact with the seats because all my weight is going through my backside, my bottom and my upper side. And I can feel up very keenly right now. And I bet all of you. But to do the same. If you are sitting down on a hard seat, it's even better. You can feel the hardness of the seats. On your backside because nearly all your weight is going through your backside down your spine. And so that's where most of the sense I mean, most of the time we'd say we can feel the seat belt, actually. Yeah, but you're also feeling your body. You're feeling your body, you're feeling your bottom. And those thighs, you know, from the seat, the seat is telling you about your body. So. I want to get to the question. 
-20.076433181762695;-1.2210427522659302;2;Sorry. No, no, no, no. Please don't. It's very obvious, but actually, I don't know if it's if it's the visual thing of being distracted with something, but or just being in your head thinking about things. But a lot of the time, they don't actually think about how we're seated or what our bodies touching. And sometimes I even get tingling legs or something. The position and I didn't notice. I was wondering if that happens to you as well, if you're distracted about something or if you're always very aware of your body. 
-19.531618118286133;-13.454075813293457;2;Yeah, good question. It was a great question, actually. Yeah. I mean, yes, I am distracted and of course, lots of people, sighted or otherwise, will be distracted. And I was going to say this actually, if you've got pain or. Some other trauma or issues in your body, like you've got a headache or a lack or any sort of any sort of pain, then this way of thinking is probably. Not not laughable, but irrelevant because most of your attention and most of your awareness will be on that paid. My daughter at the moment is pregnant, very heavily pregnant. She's got this huge. Dumped on the front of her body. So I would imagine I haven't asked you this, but I imagine most of her awareness in terms of her body is focussed on that huge bump on the front of her body. So her and her weight distribution is all of it shifted radically because of that, because of the pregnancy. But yeah, for someone who's lucky enough not to have any pain, it's quite interesting. I think anyway to think about your body in relation to what, what it is touching and how what that tells you really about the body rather than what it tells you about the world around you. 
-21.06031608581543;-10.78429889678955;2;So you can go both ways. You can turn inwards to the body. You can turn your mind outwards to the world around you, which of course, is what we do most of the time. If we're not in pain, we turn our attention outwards to the world. And if you're sighted, of course you're doing that all the time because. Your eyes. Although very prominent. Sensory mode which demands attention from you all the time and distracts you from the other sensory process or candidate. So that's why this is a mindful operation where you are conscious. I mean, you can even close your eyes to think about it if it helps, you know, consciously taking your mind. Through your body to those points of touch. 
-22.083965301513672;-8.567710876464844;2;So we've mentioned the back side and the upper sides, which is. The obvious one because that's where all the where it's going. But it's also. Just think about the bottom of your feet. Your feet. I don't know how your feet are placed at the moment, but mine more quickly. I've got my left foot is flat on the floor. I've got a stone floor that I'm sitting on. My left foot is flat on the floor and my right foot is bent under the chair and sort of at the top of my foot is on the floor, the toe of my shoe. Is on the floor, the upper the upper of the shoe, rather than the rather than the sole of my shoe. So I'm feeling the floor through my head quite well, through my left foot, because it's flat on the soles in contact with this floor. But my right foot, I'm feeling the floor through this twisted foot. That's it. That's the ceiling, the floor. It's just that one small point on the top. The up the top of my toes is sort of feeling the floor. 
-23.30514144897461;-8.967613220214844;2;So a sculpture of that would just have. The points of touch of my left foot would be the shape of my soul, and my right foot would just be a sort of irregular shape of the way that my right shoe is. Connecting with the floor in a very small. Point of touch. So that's telling me a little bit. I've got a little bit of actually there's a little bit of pain coming through my right foot because I'm twisting a little bit and I can feel the my ankle being stretched a little bit because it's not relaxed. I don't know whether you have managed to transfer your mind to your feet. Yeah. But again, are your souls on the floor in that sort of uniform way as if you were standing? Or are they twisted and turned like mine? I was completely unaware of my feet until I close my eyes. So now they feel heavy. Which feel heavy. 
-14.510958671569824;-16.618553161621094;2;It feels relaxing to place your awareness there. Actually, it makes me more tired. Yeah. To. To focus only on the way that my body was. Yeah. Yeah. The vision is destructive. It's so. Yeah. I also have my cuts on my thigh, which is light. A cut of a cut on my thigh. And I couldn't feel her before. She was nothing. And now she has gained a little weight when I'm closing my eyes. I don't know. So it's heightening your. Yes. Mm hmm. Interesting. I'm kind of crouched against the bottom of the sofa, so I'm actually on the floor, so my feet are touching, but I realise I'm in between two of the pillows from the bottom of the couch and they were kind of going into my back and I've just realised that's probably a terrible idea. So thank you. 
-21.805814743041992;-8.45612907409668;2;So you're sitting on the floor. And I'm sitting on the floor because it's just at best position to put you on this little. Yeah, yeah.  Place the feeding sound. So your voice obviously is still going down your spine and through your back side by side. It's just a bit of my spine that is kind of leaning on the bottom of the sofa and my two feet are very kind of vertically placed down on the floor together.  Okay. So your feet aren't in touch with the floor or maybe just the heels. Both of them are very, very much on the floor.  I mean, the soles are flat on the floor. 
-15.011577606201172;-16.604616165161133;2;Yeah, because I'm kind of curled up in my leg. I gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. So that's interesting. Yeah. So if you were to map out and pick out the points of touch, that would be your soles again.  My soles. The bit of my back that's touching the sofa. Bottom.  On them. Yeah. Yeah. And the other thing that I don't know if I want to say anything, but the thing that strikes me as I'm talking now is my elbows obviously taking quite a lot of weight on my elbows because I'm leaning forward to towards the screen. So as I think about it, my left elbows obviously not taking much weight because I can't feel that very well. It's there, but my right elbow is almost hurting. Now, I think about it because it's taking so much weight, because I'm sort of leaning on the table, holding the screen with one hand, and obviously quite a lot of my upper body weight is going through my right arm, down through the elbow and then. On the table. So I'm very keenly aware of the hardness of the table and as I say, a slight. Niggling pain. The more I think about it, like the person is saying, Oh, the more I think about it, the stronger that pain gets. So. 
-22.099308013916016;-11.266406059265137;2;So the other. The other touch phenomenon that we often ignore. And why shouldn't we? Is our closing? Presumably we're all fully dressed at the moment. And so we're all wrapped. We're wrapped in clothing, which has a more or less prominent position in our minds. Know, again, as a blind person, you know, you're not so aware of this. The clothing, the colour of your clothing. Although I know I tried to be, it's not as great is not as important as it would be if I was cited for what I am aware of is the weight of the clothing. The texture of the clothing and the. The fabric of. How light or heavy it is and the feel of it on my skin. So, again, you know, were I to do it? You know, sculpture. All of those points of touch. Maybe clothing would be. Part of it. I mean, would you know, again, when I was planning this piece, which never came to fruition because it was too complicated, I was going to include those parts of the body where the clothing is very prominent, like at the moment, for instance, I can feel. My genes. There are stretching around my knees because my knees are bent so that the chain material is being stretched around those knee areas because of the creasing of the fabric around the lower leg and the upper leg and the stretching over the top of the knee. So I'm very aware of those bits of my trousers and then my around my waist and my backside and my groyne. I can feel the, you know, the, the fabric of the jeans tightening around the two because I'm sitting on all the material, you know, is being scrunched up around that area because of the way the body. His position. 
-22.589340209960938;-11.293441772460938;2;So again, a sculpture a touch sculpture of that would have a lot of area of. You know, a lot of. So it would be a lot of material on display there because there's a lot of awareness that they have to go out to encounter my clothing around the area and then moving up the body. I'm not so aware of my clothing. I suppose I'm a little bit around the abdomen. You know, I can feel my. You know, I suppose a little bit of my shirt under my jumper. And then I can say that I can definitely feel the weight of my clothing on my shoulders, I can feel it almost weighing down on my shoulders as I sit and think about it. But also clothing is. Is part of this experience of your own. Body unless your naked or cosmetic change. You then become. Perhaps be more aware of the air quality there, the temperature and how the air is moving around your body if you are naked. 
-19.725648880004883;-3.6120316982269287;2;So what dawned on me as I was thinking through this sculpture that never happened. Was that the main the the parts of the body that wouldn't appear in the sculpture but actually bury the head and. Maybe the hands or part of the hands anyway. And that's interesting and ironic in a way that the head and as you've got at the moment, I'm wearing headphones and maybe some of you are as well. All of you, I don't know if you've got headphones on, then suddenly your head becomes a quite an important haptic. Event almost, because these headphones are sort of clutching a minor and clutching my head and I've got them mounted just in front of my ears. 
-19.974374771118164;-3.623476266860962;2;So they're not covering my ears. And the band over the top is sort of bearing down a little bit on my scalp so I can feel so my head is I'm aware of my head, but if I was to take my eyes off, I wouldn't really be very aware of my head. And of course, if you want if you've got a headache or you've got to cycle an itchy nose or if you've got some kind of tactile haptic sensation in your head, then obviously you will be aware of your head. But if you haven't got any of those things happening, then your head almost doesn't exist in terms of its. Phenomenal. Presents the phenomenon of the phenomenology of your head. Is quite interestingly absent. The fact that you're thinking happens in your head doesn't seem to me anyway to give your head. Had a phenomenal presence. And yeah. 
-6.677751541137695;-6.758577823638916;2;So not. I mean, so. I mean, if you if you start. Worrying or getting embarrassed or. Something's upsetting. You might start sweating, or you might start in a. So intense. And then your head might become apparent to you when a phenomenal way. But in the absence of any of those emotions or. Thanks. There's a phenomena. So say your head doesn't. Doesn't exist. Maybe. Maybe it's because of looking. Constantly looking. Oh, yeah.  Once we. Once we have our eyes open. Now we look we all the time outside of the body. Yeah. We somewhere as we. Yeah. We are a distance from the body because we where our consciousness is. Where we look.  Yeah.  We never really think. Of eyes when we look now. But if we did that, then we would be back with within the head. Mm hmm. But because we we we are seeing things. We completely leave the head. 
-10.327969551086426;1.7128897905349731;2;And I think that's really interesting because I think with blindness that normal. Way of thinking sighted. Way of thinking is reversed. He. You project? I think, yeah, with sight and maybe with sound as well. To some extent you project yourself outwards to what you're looking at or what you're listening to, because as a sighted person, when you're listening to something, you usually look at it as well. You know, if there's a sound coming from your left, you'll look to your left. 
-15.158635139465332;-0.746414065361023;2;So, you know, as a blind person, you do that a little bit as well. But because you are not seeing where the sale is coming from, so there's less of that tendency to project yourself outwards to the source of what you're listening to, what you're looking at. Mm hmm. And this is a very important point. And this part of what we're talking about, I've described in the phrase a far cry, a far cry English term, a far cry. You may have heard of it. We use it in English. It's used to describe. Something being very different from what you expected it to be. You say, you know, that that experience was a far cry from what I thought it was going to be because of far cry. When I when I looked up this phrase a far cry, it was a way in which people used to denote distance. So the further, the more the quieter a sound is, the further away it probably is, not necessarily. 
-7.898491382598877;13.988312721252441;2;But so the volume of the sound that you're listening to can tell you about it's the distance between you and and that's the source of that sound. So it's a way of measuring distance. And it was used in that way before it became used in the way that it is now to just as a sort of metaphor for. Talking about expectations and how expectations have been failed. It's a far cry from what I expected. So again, is a sort of. An example of blind aesthetic and sound. I think you do tend to bring the sounds into your body, and even though you still get this sort of sonic perspective which is available to all of us, it's less strong, I think. 
-16.972667694091797;-13.019418716430664;2;You know, I find myself gathering all the sounds I hear. Into my body and thinking about them as if they're all in my body. And I have to sort of remind myself sometimes that there is a world out there that's full of. Depth and space, distance and visual perspective. So. So I think. I mean, you know, I've just really taken you on a journey, and I'm sure there's more to be said about this. And I know there is, but I just. Taking you on a journey around your body, your own bodies, and where and how they are interacting with. Furniture, clothing. And the world around you. There's lots more to be said on the smells, tastes, and there's more to be said about sound. But this is just really meant as an introduction to how I think and I think how a lot of blind people experience the world, even though they may not sort of articulate it in this way, because, you know, often blind people are fighting their blindness. They're trying to. Move away from it. 
-14.063117980957031;-10.005370140075684;2;To try and recapture or capture a world that they think is more informative and sure might be right to some extent. But I think there's a lot about the blind experience that's very informative as well. So again, this is what my research is trying to show. So what I might do is, is finish on that dialogue and we are out of time. Finish by just listing. If you can bear with me, I list a few things, some of which we've already mentioned that I think are those things that perhaps. Capture this idea as a blind aesthetic. So just. Uh. I'm just trying to remember where I put this list now. So. Oh, yeah. So it's awesome. I'm so, so sorry. Just bear with me. Workers will now start working on. Here we go. Okay. 
-13.693238258361816;-10.617791175842285;2;So I call this a list of characteristics and experiences and phenomena that delineates the blind aesthetic. So I'm just going to listen. I don't want to say anything as I'm saying. It just just do so. But I'll just. I'll just go through them fairly quickly and I'm sure. Open things out. Okay. Okay. The first one is a strong sense of how all surfaces become one seamless continuum, part of a seamless continuum and undifferentiated and delineated unit units at Unity. And I mentioned this before, in the absence of shadows, this phenomenon, this experience is quite frequent and quite strong. Where, for instance, if I'm feeling the tabletop in front of me, if I was to look at that, 
-15.348831176757812;-7.84710693359375;2;I would see the shadows underneath and I'd know that was underneath. If you're not seeing the shadows, you're just feeling the under surface of the table. It feels much the same as the upper surface and its difference is really minimal, minimised because you don't have the shadow. So that unity of surface is what I find quite interesting and quite a strong part of the blind experience. A strong sense of continuing to resist between the Senate, the special interests and the temporal temporal. Yeah. An enhanced sense of. And this comes from an enhanced sense of transience of movements in objects, which, again, I touched on before with the transient objects. It's just a sort of stronger sense that nothing is sort of that stable. It's always on the move. That really comes from that, I suppose. 
-21.606109619140625;-3.8361427783966064;2;Maybe you could argue that the illusion of blindness is that objects disappear because you're not. When you're not touching, they're not there. So there's a sense of transience. And so the continuum between the spatial and temporal for me is much stronger with blindness. There is a heightened sense of a more panoramic reading of the environment that you're you're in again. And this comes from again, we've mentioned this. In terms of visuality, because in a sighted experience you tend to be focussed on what's in front of you or what you, where your head is turning and where your eyes are focussing because you have this two eyes that are. On the front of your head was blindness. 
-21.379735946655273;-3.7621891498565674;2;You've still got two eyes on the front of your head, but they're not working, so you don't have that focus on what's in front of you. You have a more panoramic 360 degree focus on the world. Okay. Your ears are still on the side of your head and they're binaural. In other words, the two of them. And if they're working, you're getting a stereo sonic. Raging the world, but they're not so focussed in that. Binary ways are not. Fixed to the front of your head and on the sides of your head, they tend to give you a more 360 degree. Few as a world of this manifests itself and you're just walking along with a sighted person, walking with the sunshine as they tend, they tend to be fixed on what's in front of them. And I'm often. Fixed on what's all around me rather than what's in front of me, because I'm responding to that 360 degree experience. 
-11.93104362487793;-2.189556360244751;2;Can I just ask you from your experience, is this something that you've learnt throughout your stages of blindness, this idea of like opening you, listening to the side rather than to the front? Do you feel like that's something that you have to learn? No, I think what you have to learn, though, is, I mean, it's there and it's there in all of us sighted people as well. You have to learn how to even have to learn that it is a thing that is worth talking about and practise. 
-10.73394775390625;-2.252044677734375;2;I guess you also have to like practise it. Because yeah. I think when you become aware of it, it's like anything. When you become conscious of it, you then start thinking about it more. Oh yeah, that is happening. But that is that is happening. And that must be happening to, first of all, all blind people. But secondly to everyone, not just my people. You are just as capable, aren't you, as a sighted person? If you are sighted of having that 360 degree awareness, if your hearing is efficient, then your. And able to do that 360 thing but. We tend to be taught not to because it's probably, you know, when you walk in is probably safer to. 
-14.615784645080566;-1.7376158237457275;2;To get to have a mono. Yeah. Not to be thinking 360 because, you know, you can follow things. Mm hmm. When I was a child or something, you know, you need to be very conscious, so, you know, is not something to be played around with, but it's something to be aware of and alert. I think it's just learning and it's part of a bigger picture. This, you know, the blind aesthetic I'm learning is big. It's a big thing and this is just a small part of it, but it's a very prominent it's very important part of it, even though it's. Only part of it. But it's funny you should say. You have to learn whether you have to learn. I've learnt far more about my own blindness since I've sort of been studying in college. I've been living now for 60 something years. I've been blind for 30 of those. I've actually learnt far more about myself in the last three years because I've been studying. But I think I've been experiencing it for a lot longer. 
15.750470161437988;3.2775514125823975;2;Yeah, that's really interesting. Actually, my dad is going through blindness now, so it's been five year. He's almost fully blind now. But it's. It's very like. Yeah, it's quite interesting because I think he's not at this stage. That's why I was asking about learning. He's still at the stage you were describing of wanting to get the side back and accepting. So it's super interesting. And he's already starting to get like physiotherapy and then all this kind of like awareness of space. And I will watch bit what was happening in the session and yeah, that was exactly it. But that's what I was wondering about this learning. But maybe you're right more about finding this awareness and. 
-8.653800964355469;-1.2572911977767944;2;Then just yeah, I mean, I think it's good that people want to try and overcome it if they're in partial sight or, you know, it's a good mindset. But on the other hand, there's a positive side to it, which is what I mentioned in my reading that paper about blindness gain, disability gain. People find that hard to accept because how can you accept that disability? So anything good about it at all? We should all be fighting it, you know? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I do not. 
-8.563970565795898;-0.6644784808158875;2;Know. There are good that there are good things that come out of it. And you've got I think there is also a psychological side to that because if you aren't able to fight it. Then you know, you need something nice, something to look forward to, to get you out of bed in the morning. Otherwise, it's kind of depressing. So your father is you know, your dad is right to right. But he might. He might also be interested to learn that. Yeah, exactly. I think that's what we have. We are going now, we are making a film together and that's like the idea is to try to. 
-2.9107367992401123;-5.141273021697998;2;He's making something. Yeah, well, he's kind of given some money to make a film and he's involved in it thinking about. Yeah, but then way of perceiving without cognition or something like that. So yes. Getting on this journey as well. Yeah. Yeah. That's why I was asking about this idea of learning from that. 
-15.948834419250488;-12.485960960388184;2;Yeah. Interesting. Thank you. I'll just play one with this list. Unless. However, during the time. Okay. Know, just to be clear. Okay. So an everyday heightened awareness of auditory auditory encounters. Well, that's we've been talking quite a lot about that, although not that much. We're talking more about touch, but the auditory is obviously a big area of heightened awareness. Okay. So I just talk a little bit about this sort of heightened awareness. It brings whether it's a heightened awareness of the richness and diversity of the sounds that are around you. And again, you know, it sounds obvious to say that, but actually, if you stop and think about not focussing on one particular sound, just try and focus on. The entirety of the orchestra of sounds that are around you. John Cage Obviously you've come across John Cage's writing. He talks a lot about this sort of thing, you know, and how music just isn't an isolated phenomenon. It come, it emerges from a world of sounds, of which it is an integral part. And you shouldn't try and separate. The two. You know, but just again, you know, just walking around or. Being in the world, you become much as a blind person. You become kind of obviously you become much more aware of this rich diversity of sounds and a huge amount of information to that does give you the next. 
-16.458831787109375;-11.91856575012207;2;Yeah, the next item on the list is a heightened sense of sonic perspective. Well, again, we've mentioned that as well. So that's the information that it gives you. The the volume, the intensity of the sounds that are around you, give you information about where you are situated in the world. And that's really useful. And it's a really beautiful thing to. To dwell on as well as you. A sense of place and space, just as rich as the visual clues that you get from the same sort of thinking. But. Again, becoming aware of that and really experience enjoying it is something else. My story. Yeah. So this nice one is what we've been talking about all afternoon or sorry on the session, which is a heightened sense of the tactile environment. The ground under your feet, the clothing on your body. The skin. The weather on the skins. They? Yeah. Sorry. I'm just listening to my notes. They're the proximal encounters with everyday objects and their resistance to your touch or otherwise. You just become. I suppose you just become more sensitive, more aware of those encounters, those tactile encounters. And it's just a, again, a rich diversity of those different qualities of objects and surfaces that you come across. You just become more aware. I remember suddenly becoming readily, much more aware of flooring surfaces as I was walking around, because when you're walking, that's the main one. Sometimes the only point of touch that you have with your environment is what's under your feet is the only points of touch. 
-11.094406127929688;-3.1391940116882324;2;So the surfaces under your feet are a very important source of information about. What about the ground around you? Not just under your feet, but around you? So again, a heightening of that awareness. Oh, yeah. This is an interesting one. Like a strong continuity of visual experience despite total blindness. Again, right at the beginning, I was talking about my experiences going to audio descriptions and how suddenly I realised I could see vision. Well, obviously I couldn't actually see it. There was not light, but I was seeing paintings again that I wasn't well. I knew the most dramatic ones were the ones that I remember seeing as a sighted person, and they were there again because of the description and all the excitement I got from them as a sighted person. I was still getting from the description, but yeah, as much intensity as before I would, you know, how do you measure intensity? How do you measure that when you can't? I just remember feeling thrilled at that re birth, as it were, of the visual experience that I was totally blind. So, you know, that's quite incredible to my mind. An incredible thing about blindness is that you can still see. 
17.60968780517578;7.9840264320373535;2;I just I was just just wanted to ask if maybe you spoke with someone who has been blind their entire life. Because basically what I'm wondering is what's the possibility in audio description? Like, does it only bring memories that have been somehow coded in our brain, in your brain, when you as you said, you saw paintings that you've seen in the past? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I was just wondering if you spoke with people who are actually like, what does it do to them to these descriptions? And like, how does that like what kind of experience does that mean basically? 
-15.802083969116211;-4.298964977264404;2;It's really good question. And it's the most common question that's asked when I give these sort of talks. But that's really understandable question. I use the word coded, which is interesting. It is a kind of a coding, although that suggests some kind of sort of machine learning type sort of intervention. But I think it's sort of like coded, but it's more about this is I try to capture in the word an omniscience, this idea of omniscience, which is a sort of deep memory, deep, pre, experiential a priori. If I could cross that term knowledge that we all have, blind or otherwise, we're all born with knowledge. I think not. You know, not all knowledge, but some knowledge. We're born knowing how we're born. Knowing how to see. We open our eyes if we if our eyes are working and we see we don't have to be taught how to see. So. And that you know that for the fact of seeing just a tape saying from one example is that's not learnt is it? We just do it because we've got eyes. We've got a brain that is ready to see. The optical part of the brain is ready unless you've got brain damage. But if you've got a healthy brain, it's ready to see. 
-13.591964721679688;-3.2629668712615967;2;So people who've never seen have got it. So I don't see brains. Then they've got that propensity, that predisposed disposition to see, even if their eyes aren't working and have never worked, they won't have that post. I posteriori the post. Learnt they won't have the experience of seeing actual colours in the lines, for instance. But they, they hope they'll know. They'll know about colours. They may not know how to. Talk about them. They have to be taught, like everyone else, to be taught how to talk about colours. They need names and descriptions and. A ways of describing the experience of seeing colours and light. The colours. The brain is ready to see colours. The brain is ready to see the world. So what I call congenitally blind people, people who've never seen have that. 
13.910593032836914;-7.421310901641846;2;Sting documentary, I don't remember what it's called, but it was about people who had never seen that then had these eye operation. Tremendously. And then they took quite a long time to actually adjust to what they were seeing because they couldn't depth. They would. Yeah, it's really interesting because somehow, obviously there is this innate capability of of seeing that is not learnt, but then there is still that learning period but just yeah.  Yeah. Oh yeah. I mean that's very scary and dramatic event, but I think that's a different thing to sort of the question of whether they've never seen kind of experience visuality is a different question. 
-2.2741920948028564;8.443428993225098;2;I mean, I didn't I didn't really mean because of course, there is this memory that is like that doesn't come from direct experience. I didn't mean whether they can experience visuality. What I maybe was focussed more on is the issue of language where you know, for you a painting, the description of a painting that you've seen in the past. That's why I maybe I use the word coded, you know, because there's the innate ability versus learnt knowledge. Maybe that's what I was just, you know, kind of trying to get my head around. And in that sense, what these other descriptions. I don't know. I guess this is something that we've been thinking and talking a lot with. I gotta of how what what are they supposed to be and like how who is supposed to create them and to what extent they're meant to be. These are very direct descriptions and like, how far can you go with it? 
-3.663663148880005;10.83349323272705;2;Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm not sure there's an opposition between. Between. Pretty experienced. Visuality and experience visuality though not. They're not verses each other. They're not against each other. They are all part of the same. Dynamic process of living. So but yeah. The relationship between. Description. Of visual experience. And having a visual experience is interesting and very complex. Because it relies on all sorts of variables. You know, the words that they describe a use chooses to describe things the way they describe events, the degree to which the description is sort of subject, you know, a subjective or an object set of description, which is very important. And for myself, I prefer a much more subjective description where the described is really involved with, say, whatever they describe, it doesn't have to be a painting, but just to take paintings as an example, if they really enjoying or hating, you know, they've got an extreme response to the painting and they're very articulate. And then I guess I get to. Feel that with them. And I would also like to try and understand. What the artist was trying to were trying to express his or her self in the painting. So that's something that's a little more complicated to. To describe that. Yeah, I hear what you're saying. 
-4.422354698181152;11.353272438049316;2;So the relationship between what's been described and what you're experiencing as the sort of consumer of that description is complex. And I. I just know from my own experience how powerful that is. It's not relationship. That's. So that's got to do with the words and the performance of the audio description and also how you're feeling. As a as a as an individual listening to a description, you know, how you're feeling and how your brain how your how receptive you are as well to. So description. You might not be someone who is used to being having things described to you. So you might be used to enjoying other people's words. As a source of. Experiencing anything. So does that help or not? Yeah. I mean, the second part was not really a question anyway, so. 
25.369417190551758;-7.440298557281494;2;No, no, no, no, no. It's an observation. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, yeah. I mean, it's a really interesting subject and something I haven't really dug into as much as I should, perhaps. But I also feel that what your description doesn't necessarily describe visuals for me. I mean, I don't know when I listen to a description. They really sounds like audio book that my dad listened to and audio books, they are books that are being read. So it's like this world without images anyways. And I feel like it's more about describing, yeah, yeah. Like you said of the subjective experience, the feelings, the station, rather than trying so hard to describe what's, let's say in cinema. Yeah. Shown on the screen or something. 
-17.233257293701172;-3.5954599380493164;2;Yeah, that's right. And this reminds me of an interview I had with somebody who was talking about the difference between a book and a film adaption of the book. If you read a book, the writer has just it is focussing your mind on one thing, or at least they're in charge of the focus of your mind on a specific saying or a specific. Group of things. The film adaption of that. But they've got far more scope for focussing the viewer's mind on a much wider sort of group of things. You know, you can the camera can be on the main character, for instance, talking, but the character will be standing in an environment which you can look at as a viewer and you can. Okay. The director has made sure that what you're saying is also managed properly. But nevertheless, you are free to look at that screenshot and see what you want from it. Whereas in a book you haven't got that freedom. I mean, you've got you have got a freedom to think about it, but you haven't got a freedom. 
-4.383823871612549;11.022140502929688;2;To move your attention. From the words. That are delivered to you in the book. And that's the same as an audio description. No description. They've decided what words to use. They've decided what you're going to know about what they're describing in a very specific or quite a specific way. That's why I like a more emotional, subjective description where they're likely to give more of themselves, as they describe it, than they would otherwise do. So you learn you'll actually probably end up learning as much about the driver as you do about what they're describing. But that's you know, that's quite interesting, I think. But if you want to know just about the painting and how big it is and what the composition is and what materials are used and the techniques that is to the size and the art history of the painting, you know, all that stuff, all the information, all that contextual and it's interesting stuff. But that's not. Not one I want from an audio description. I want to enjoy the painting. 
-4.041101455688477;12.446981430053711;2;Would what would happen if a machine created an audio description? Sure. On the face of it, I would think it would be it's a bit like a. Machines that write music, you know? It's kind of seductive at one level, but it's such a very superficial level. The gratification you derive from the music or the description, I think the gratification for me would be very superficial. The depths that a human intense to human can and can't with with a well-chosen series of words and inflexion. It's not just the words. It's the ways. It's a way. You say it, doesn't it? The inflexion is what? Well, I wish I could write. I can't see how a machine ever. I can I can copy someone doing it. I can simulate the simulation. We then get into notions about simulation of whether simulation. Simulacra. Uh. Not as good an experience as the original. 
30.102054595947266;-0.41347914934158325;2;I'm really curious about how you think language plays into the blind aesthetic. Like especially, I mean, just like I'm even just thinking about some of the things that have come up, like how, how you find that you have a preference towards sort of a more subjective description of something as opposed to certain objective, which in so many ways is about this kind of like really falsified manmade idea of like, you know, creating almost robotic thinking within the human body, which is very odd, you know, and I'm I think I'm just also thinking about some of the things you've said about like sensing surfaces as a non delineate unity. Mm hmm. This idea of sort of the panoramic. Mm hmm. This kind of notion of sort of continuum and flow. And then I'm also thinking about the the Braille Moebius Strip piece that you made. And I'm wondering if they're, like, outside of visuality or if we're thinking about language outside the primacy of the visual? Mm hmm. Is there I don't know. Is there sort of like like an extended potential within like that's sort of I don't know if you want to call, like, panoramic tactility or could there be a delineated unity of language? I don't know if that's to a an abstract. 
-3.684856653213501;11.89274787902832;2;No, it's really marvellous. There's there's so much so much that. But the yeah. Again, the, the complexity and intricacies of how language works to do what it does and in the way that I've been trying to describe, you know, in audio description and why I prefer a more subjective description than an object is one. Why I. That excites me more than the other way. Is is it, I think, hugely complex and very interesting to think about. I'm not trying to avoid. The question. I just say it's a huge area of probably a strong interest in that. I think it's probably to do with the fact that you are two human beings. Maybe one, two or more as one human being doing the description and you as the consumers that you're relating to that human being in a very direct way. So you're you're you're responding to the to the to the human being behind the description who is delivering it. And he's the he or she is delivering it in response to something else. There's just this object in front of us, you know, wherever it is. 
-3.0496411323547363;10.637784004211426;2;So this is triangulation going on between two human beings and an object. There's something about that. Triangulation that. Relationship. That's a three way relationship. That's really behind it. And if you don't mind the complexity behind the scenes that are behind the. Reason. I, for one, prefer a more. Emotional, emotive, subjective, expressive description. Something to do with that triangulation. Mr. Assange. Oh yeah. I experienced an audio description once where the person describing it really didn't want to describe to me he was he wasn't an art lover. He wasn't very articulate. He wanted to be somewhere else. He didn't want to be with me, I don't think. And then we were in a gallery and. He said, Oh yeah, right here in front of a painting now. And I said, Well, well, would you mind just describing it to me, please? And he said, All right, then. Because he was quite fed up, you know, this sort of cross. They said, Well, it's green and I don't like it. And that was it. And so on one level that's quite amusing, but on the other level. So there's just so much history in the making. And for that it's probably almost nothing about the painting. But it told me a whole lot of stuff about the described the. The person does not. So, again, you know, it's this three way, three way relationship that's going on that's probably behind. 
16.82672119140625;15.625150680541992;2;Yeah. I think it's it's amazing. David, the way you speak about this visual visual aspect of not seeing or the ways that it opens up so many new connexions to the world in the way that people with sight, especially in contemporary society, can be, as we already mentioned, kind of as the image and also like mono focussed. And I guess for people in the arts we're kind of maybe a bit more aware of the other senses and it's quite a lot with sound, but maybe we're more attuned to the world in various ways. But I think, you know, for a big percentage of the population, it's really it's really exciting the way you describe and relate in such since fraudulent and deep ways to every sense and this kind of like kind of holistic view, this 30, 60 view of the world. And yeah, so I just wanted to say, to say thank you for kind of managing our experiences as well. 
5.39650821685791;-4.372058391571045;2;So thank you. Thank you very much for saying so. Yeah. And well I'm glad that it's as if if you've had thanks that response to it. Yeah. It's been marvellous actually to be able to to talk about it in this quite free way actually. Usually I'm sort of. I'm usually, you know, in college giving presentations and stuff that we have to do, which I'm sure you've all gone through and, you know, sort of able to sort of stretch out in the way that I've been able to stretch out more today. My life know I relish that opportunity. And actually I notice that it is. 8:00. I don't mind sitting for a bit longer if anyone wants to say anything else. I don't want to keep people if they need to go. 
17.852689743041992;9.366950988769531;2;I also kind of want to say that it's like a just say something today that in a group we're all seeing the video and looking at you at each other talking. And the image I notice comparing of I was imagining your experience of talking with us. Hmm. And that kind of angry listen to what you said about the description is like this experience we had today. For me, I feel like it's because we were all here together. Is it? It doesn't need necessarily like a description of what it is because we're all experiencing it and like the audio description maybe is like maybe just more people rather than describing what I see, what you see and imagining for someone who can't see there is imagine what you see and describe in relation to that imagination, which feel like a very articulated set point about what you could possibly be saying is more like just. Telling another person about what I see. What is that like? Hmm. Like other people describing, like, very subjectively, what they see. 
8.87049674987793;13.780431747436523;2;Mm hmm. Just another voice. Rather than being like. That's their voice. That's. They were describing what it is. So that's interesting. And make me think of like, well, working with performance is always thinking, like imagining what the viewer, how they're going experience. But at the same time, in the live situation, it doesn't necessarily have that kind of like people can experience differently. Yeah I've how they the environment going to play out another person there next to how they're bracing how they smell they'll play a part to that live experience. So that's why. 
22.981197357177734;-7.398971080780029;2;No.Yeah I just make that more of rather than predicting and then tapping to the prediction. Rather than what's right rather. Than tapping into the prediction of what we're gonna expect is. Yeah. More open. I think that's right. Yeah.And then that's like, like amazing that you disrupt that very beautiful place. And it's, it is a skill, like, kind of a practise and you learn. How to. Balance. Yeah. Yeah, right. Yeah. Go ahead. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. I think in realising that everyone actually experiences in a very different way from each other, sometimes you think, yeah, how others are perceived. But actually each one of us is very specific. And yeah. 
-9.97160530090332;-4.737898826599121;2;That's very true. We do. But there's also a commonality. You know, we're all humans and therefore there is a sort of overlap and that sort of Venn diagram sort of way. There's a, there's, there's common ground between us, that's why. Two people encountering a piece of art or something that's been described. The overlap, I think, is huge. And maybe that's the. The mark of the quality of the art is if it is art that they're describing. If the artist has caused those two people to have more of an overlap in the sort of enjoyment of the art. Then maybe this is a sign of a successful artwork. If there isn't much overlap between them, then maybe it's not such a successful piece of art. So maybe the audio description. You know, works. The more overlap you've got between those two people with respect to that piece of art, the more they overlap deep halves of them, the better the audio description. And yes, some people might want a more objective and a less involved audio description, and that's that way they get more of an overlap. Some somehow I can't see how that would work. But that's just me. Then, you know, because that's just as. Just as sort of valid. As my needs and desire for a more involved. Description to get that over. 
-15.794241905212402;-4.586960792541504;2;I've I've got a friend of mine who's an autistic writer and academic and he would always just like when we were talking about the way that he thinks about writing, he described it and the way that he sort of thinks about. Subjects is he? He described it as taking a poke, taking a piece of string and wrapping it around. A subject. And, you know, sort of by doing this sort of rapping, you show the form of the thing that you're trying to discuss.  Wow. 
0.8239817023277283;-4.5963134765625;2;And it really got me thinking about this, you know, like what you're saying, this idea of sort of the subjective overlap and almost, you know, the richness of having an encounter with an artwork, almost as if all these sort of subjective positions are a hug. Mm hmm. It's weird. I think I was just picturing almost a group hug. Yeah. Enveloping something in the hands, laying over top of the other hands. The arms and. Yeah. And there. There's something so much richer to that than, say, square. 
24.289134979248047;-7.41789436340332;2;Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This by this sentence.That me says. Yeah.Yeah. But it's like you said, there's like in, in the, you know, the wrapping of the string or the enfolding of the hands or the language kind of coating itself around this thing. You got this, like, beautiful 3D. Image your experience and yeah, that's really I don't know it's really gorgeous way of thinking. 
0.34912949800491333;-3.589055299758911;2;Yeah, I like the string idea actually. That's really nice. I'm imagining lots of string. Yeah. These threads of sort of energy and love or. Yeah, love. It's got to be love, I guess. Yeah. Going out to the object and wrapping through root around the object and thereby, you know, giving it shape and meaning and can. I suppose there's a wonderful love you come across is going to call them. Heath Robinson is no old. Graphic and graphic novelist. Right. He was a and the British artist from the early 20th century used to do these whimsical comedy pictures of imaginary machines that he sort of just dreamt up. They didn't do anything. They were just sort of cogs on wheels. And that, you know, which was just love machinery, I think. And then imagining these imaginary machines, drawing them, painting them. And a lot of them had bits of string that connected the different elements of the machine. The bits of string often had a little knot in them as if the string had broken and it just tied it back together to keep the machine going. And then little touches like that was very humorous in a sense, reminded me of Heath Robinson. 
27.545730590820312;-3.2361319065093994;2;They're kind of wonderful. They sort of reminds me of. Yeah, they've they've got the feel of, you know, the squiggly hands that would move all around. Like the the animated Monty Python sequences. I know you just get these weird little sort of squiggly hands, and these, like, long arms are completely looping things. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, so what you what you're saying about group hugs and sort of action group that. Well, that that's the sort of overlapping I was talking about where we're kind of enjoying things together. We don't really know why, but we know that we are enjoying it together. It's like that sort of thing. You get in concerts and festival situations where you got a sort of mass or. Sort of groups of people all loving something at the same time. And, you know, you come across these situations where people just look at each other and smile knowingly, as it were, to each other. You know, they both encountered something similarly marvellous and joyful. And it's just just acknowledge that with a smile. Like a knowing smile. So it's not. That reminded me of that sort of phenomenon you get and situations. Yeah.Totally. 
-2.3936359882354736;8.480072975158691;2;Yeah. And I think, you know, you can get that with description descriptions quite often of I've come across described as you've said, I've really enjoyed describing this to you because it's made me look. More intensely or differently at what I'm describing. And I've noticed things, I've seen things and I've enjoyed things about was painting or whatever it is they're describing in a different way, you know. So again, this is back to this idea of disability gain or just blindness gain that often the disabled person or the disabled group will engender will generate knowledge and love, I suppose, or. And in an enriched experience for the for the describe. Because they because they are describing. They wouldn't have heard that without a description. So, you know, it's not just the benefit is not just travelling in one direction of the benefit. Like your string in the string goes in two directions, doesn't just go from used to the object to comes back again. It's like a current and I suppose a current and pass into. I guess I don't know too much about it, but the piece of wire. Transmits the current. The current can go in either direction. Try. All right. I don't don't into electronics because I'm out of my depth. But at least the strain is definitely changing to different. But the connexion is is to what it is that. Thanks to the. 
-0.7296853065490723;-15.725317001342773;2;Operation of the string that create more waves. Of evaporation from this great stream of waste. Evaporation on the string.  In the ways of metaphors. Yeah. That's kind of also that we can also use the metaphor of waving or stewing, thinking like similarly using a string that you're pulling things together and throwing things together. What I use my research, I a I think of the idea of like a dinner table.  A dinner table, right? I want to sit on this dinner table to have this conversation. Mm hmm. Like, I have dried out there and have, like, a group out on the other side, a table, and they might have a conversation. And like that one artist or another, like, I think that's like, a different matter for us. Metaphors, I kind of wonder. Mm hmm. Or others metaphor. But I also have a question that you mentioned earlier about the body sculpture.  Mm hmm. I had obstacle of realising idea. Mm hmm. And I wonder, what would you. If you want to talk about the obstacles you. 
-16.331893920898438;-16.624073028564453;2;Oh, yeah. Yeah. Actually, yeah. That's quite interesting, because I had started to make it with an assistant, a technician from the RCA Rapid Form Department, and we've got quite a long way along the road of making it. And we were both getting quite excited about it because it seems to be showing. Quite well. And then. It started going badly wrong because we came across. Sort of crossroads of development that we couldn't think of a way of overcoming. It was just technically too difficult to. Create. What I wanted to create is create this. It was a it was literally a person sitting at a table on a on a seat and just picking out. Those areas that I was describing earlier, those touch points. Some of them are quite big touch points. The closing, I think I think we included closing. 
-20.13332176208496;-8.100411415100098;2;Or maybe not. No, no, no. I don't think we did. We were talking about closing, and then we decided that if we included closing, it would be too. There would be too much showing. Other would be too much of body. So we wanted to sort of minimise the amount of material, I guess, to talk about. It was more about. Those connexion points with the furniture. So the arm on the arms on the table, the backside on the seat, the feet on the ground. Yeah, we do. Yeah, we try to use clothing to connect them. That's right. To connect. So, for instance, the feet on the ground, we're going to be connected with something. Bits of string, maybe. I'm not even sure I thought of this as trying to to the knees. For instance, I was talking about earlier about. 
-17.542768478393555;-7.20962381362915;2;So trousers all across the fabric being stretched across the knee so you could feel your knees. And we thought we should join the feet because of the touch points on the ground with knee points, and then those could connect with them. The back side touching the seat points. You know, we sort of worked it out with quite a high level of sort of resolution, but it failed. We had to we we sort of gave up because it was getting too complicated and it's just sort of left it's sort of left on the backburner, so to speak. It's just an idea. So that's it? It was stopped for technical and sort of. Practical reasons from time and. Achievability. I see. 
-16.819080352783203;-2.4042985439300537;2;But I still love them. I mean, I quite like the I the idea and the fact that it may never become a tangible object is, you know, in a way I've done another piece called Blind. I stand before a mirror so that basically looking at yourself in the mirror when you can't see. So. Well, I actually think that the piece is in my head. So it can never be separated. It's in my head and will always be in my head. I mean, I have actually made a mirror. For this piece, which is just one. She's actually a mirror, a real mirror. So you can see yourself, whoever you are, you can see yourself. And then the next part of the piece is a photograph of me reflected in the mirror. So you can look at that as a slight difference. But I can't. And then there's a blank shape, which is the same shape as the mirror, which is just blank wood. So it's all about sort of levels of. 
-15.596606254577637;-2.6334645748138428;2;As far as levels of sensory awareness of yourself. And of course, you know, as a blind person, mirrors don't work at all. But the idea of a mirror does work. I mean, I can I can imagine myself reflected in the mirror. And so that's the art that imagined that imagined image to imagine a moment of. In a vision. I suppose that's that's the word. And the bits that I've produced are a kind of. Just a secondary. Expression of that idea. And that's all that other people will be able to see. Those bits that I've made, which is nothing really like what I what I've got in my head, which I can never exhibit. 
-6.6362833976745605;-5.802096366882324;2;David and I had a big discussion with the with an ex now boyfriend of mine and I was saying that artworks could exist in people's heads before their actual execution is they know it has to exist to be an artwork. But my.  Response. Yeah, yeah. Well, I suppose. I suppose it starts off as an idea in someone's head, doesn't it? I guess, yeah. So the birth of art is in the head, but. But yeah, it's debateable as to what happens thereafter. Whether that is the art or whether. What you're doing is just a facsimile or a similar simulacrum. That's you know, that's kind. 
-16.44472312927246;-2.038496494293213;2;It's another big topic. To philosophical debate that will have no resolution. What you can do is I think, you know, argue your corner and make art that somehow expresses your views on that very thing. And I guess that's what this piece says for blind. I stand before a mirror. That is the image of thoughts whose tessellations are both the instrument and the object of reflection. It's all about images of thought. Jigsaw puzzles as well that all and all the mirrors of jigsaw puzzles so. H h you say a society person is as is divided up into these jigsaw puzzle pieces which just break up the image somewhat of these lines running around these lines running around the image all the time. A jigsaw puzzle shines that so much and I still think natural for me. Anyway, the art is in my head. Thus far I get far from that. In a lineage that I do from the pieces I've made here. 
-0.5052679777145386;-16.582185745239258;2;I just wanted to say that I have to leave because it's my mum's birthday. Oh, my God. Thank you so much, David and Sarah. And hopefully we'll meet one day. Thank you so much for coming. By from. DC soon. Mm hmm. You. And I can use either any specific. Things you wanted to raise about their uptown project. Mm hmm. Or says, Oh, this is what we've done. And you can. And do you, um. Do you have any things you'd like to, uh, you'd like to mention? 
0.8616564869880676;-17.092498779296875;2;I think in terms of talking with you, David, about the project, I think we're going to maybe do it at another point. Do remember we mentioned maybe we meet with Eric as well to talk about that forum. Mm hmm. I think. I don't think now. Mm hmm. The. No. Yeah. It's getting very late in Helsinki, so I think we should. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Yeah. What is the time overlap? Oh, it's about half term. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Thanks for sticking around. Oh, no. Thanks for being here. Mm hmm. Totally. My pleasure. 
-12.759023666381836;0.03122769296169281;2;Something we've got to maybe talk a bit about the previous session and some questions, but I think. I. I think it's already quite late, so maybe we can go another time. I don't. Next time. Am you. You've been talking for quite a long time, Davey. Thanks as well. Thank you so much. Oh, my pleasure. Thanks for having me. I've enjoyed I've enjoyed it thoroughly. And as I said, thanks for the opportunity to sort of free associate. You know, just to have that freedom to stretch out is quite unusual. So thanks for the phrase you've raised and very everyone's raised some really interesting points which have made me think. 
2.7310774326324463;-13.112238883972168;2;Yes. Thank you for finding time for us. Pleasure. Especially at the moment. Yeah. That's been a welcome break from mine. Yes. I hope it was a good break for you. Yes, definitely. Maybe thought provoking. Yeah. All right, Maria, perhaps you could send me the recording when? Yes. And we'll be in touch when we think about maybe some traces, some of that after this session, something we could share with people outside of our group. Will we be in touch? Okay. All right. All right. We'll wrap it up, then, Joey. Yes, I guess. I guess. Yes. Maybe we should stop here and we'll be in touch soon. Yeah. 
-3.566391706466675;29.15937614440918;3;The sound can be. The sound within the digital medium can be represented. Different ways. It could be represented as an audio file, as a set of numerical values, also as a, you know, as a visual representation. It can be decomposed and. And. Could be subjected to like different kind of analysis and so on. And all of these. Aspects. Of, of, of, of sounds kind of decomposed and analysed can be used as a compositional material or rather as a kind of operational material when considering the sound composition or composition. Which with which computers. 
12.805070877075195;12.76086711883545;3;Let me Try now because my presentation will involve sharing my screen and sound. So. Very often it doesn't work out the first time. So I just need to set up a couple of things. Maybe in the meantime, what would be useful for me also. To hear. Maybe like one or two sentences from each of you, like, you know, like say your name, maybe. Where you're based. And what's your what's your practise. And and I can kind of divide my attention to like to listen to that and also to set up the system here. So if we start from.  You know, from. Next I mean, I know how that goes already. So if we start with. 
-2.164658546447754;-9.488652229309082;3;Yeah. However you want, like whoever wants to go first. What should I call names? Yeah. So maybe Pietro. I see you are your first. First. The next. Still, I gotta. One sec. Can you hear me? Okay, so I just plugged into a computer. Okay. I'm originally from Italy, but I live in London now and my background is actually as well in this musical position of programming. So. And low income super. 
-5.994595527648926;5.950320720672607;3;And that makes Ada.  I go by other Ada. Okay.  I got a name from Ada Lovelace. And so I'm originally from China, and now me, London. So now I'm finishing up my Ph.D., a practise based in performance and about two miles to my hand doing my thesis. Some kind of everywhere at the moment. And I know the pain. I've just submitted my Ph.D. dissertation. So and I.  Know, I know. Well, what? What strand of you answer? Yes. Yeah. Thank you. So I am currently I'm working kind of derived from my practise and my research that I've been working with telematic technology and virtual patching and like wearable sound and composition and devices technology to create participatory workshops. And also I'm starting to teach in the summer interdisciplinary practise and research for kids. So that's what I'm doing now. 
0.042511384934186935;16.46721839904785;3;Sir. Thanks a lot. Next one.  Is Lea. I'm Leah and French. I've been living in London for 14 years. And then I just got back to France last year to follow a programme in the north of France that's come missing. Well, it's like a production programme for two years. We have the financing to the production of two projects and one is a film and the other one has to somehow deal with new technology, which is really broke. But I kind of work around us like how technology has affected our relationship so very much to do with ethics and emotions online. And also I'm trying to write a deep proposal on feminism and in relation to niche arts from a non-Western perspective. And I also do quite a lot of teaching with kids, which I love doing, and I think it really feeds my practise where we try to do those kind of feeds at workshops where we try to subvert social media, which is quite nice as well. So that's what I'm doing. 
-7.53311014175415;6.420812129974365;3;So thank you. And next is Ramona. I'm Ramona. I'm based in London. I work a lot with image making, mainly photography. I'm kind of analogue a lot working with the tactile, the material, the physical and installations. And you're finding new ways to show process, not just image in a way. Super. And then it's the. I don't know if I'm pronouncing it.  Don't worry about. Yeah. SATs. I was born and grew up in Nelson's in Greece. And now I live in London for the past eight years. I am working with images, field recordings and in situ installations. And for the past two years I'm also teaching sporadically and I'm interested generally in pedagogy more and more, and especially the one that embraces silence and nonverbal interactions. So that's my most recent field of enquiry. So thank you. Thank you. 
-7.2687296867370605;5.074254035949707;3;Next, there is someone called Ivan. I think that must be me.Yeah. Happy? My name is. No, I think it is Tania. I'm originally from Wales, but I live in London. I mainly work with video photography and installation and have recently started writing something along the lines of Autofiction, which is kind of a new strand to my practise. So yeah. Great.  Next is Rachel. 
-8.287879943847656;5.879249095916748;3;Hi. I'm Rachel. My Canadian was based in L.A. for a while. I'm based in London, and my work is kind of functions and not the intersection between language, a culture, archaeology. And in a lot of ways, I'm really interested in finding ways to undercut, I guess, dominant narratives, but especially historic ones. And look at ways of thinking about the sort of collision of various narratives and various histories and how to sort of represent these things. So, you know, sometimes it's hypertext, sometimes it's other. 
-6.284770488739014;2.574895143508911;3;Stuff. Yeah. Thank you. And we have Nate not. Mm hmm. Or Natalie is not that. Well, I am from Poland and I'm Boston, and I'm based in London, and I am an artist. I work with installation and performance and CGI, and I look into natural environments and rituals and ideas of functionality and body and the things that this and I work in the archive. And yeah, I think that's a really.  Sit down. We have Maya.  Oh, no. Sorry. Eric. Eric. Yeah. Hey, I'm Eric. Can you hear me? Yeah. Yeah, I actually have a background in sound and programming as well, and I've also studied maths and science now when I've grown up between Finland and the UK. Now I'm in Finland doing some AI related research at a university. 
-4.603809356689453;3.377265214920044;3;You. Great. Thank you. And we have Maya. Yeah. Hi. Sorry I'm terribly late. No, it's fine. I usually sing ourselves. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. So. Okay, just.  Just quickly. Sorry. Where you are based and what's your practise? It's just that I'm not a big speech.  Okay. Yeah. So, I mean, I'm based in London, I'm currently in Toronto for like a few weeks and I guess I also studied photography. So that's the background of my artistic practise. But I've been using video and object making in my practise, but I'm generally more kind of a very analytical person than digital, but I'm kind of trying to change that in my practise. Struggling, but trying. 
-5.3416337966918945;4.265680313110352;3;Okay, cool. And this last one is Sarah. Sarah. Sarah. Hello. Uh, sorry. I'm on a bus going to Portugal. Can you hear me okay? Yeah, we can hear you. I used to live in London for ten years. Back to Portugal to live in the middle of kind of an oak forest. So I'm having more and more an integrated practise because I started looking into a lot of ecological subjects and issues, and that took me here. And then. Yeah. Sorry. I'm just. It's been a lot, trip, because I'm on the bus because the bus got stuck, and then we had to change because my car got confiscated by the police, which was also fun. And I have to bring tyres up a kilometre up the terrain where I live anyway. So. Yeah. Sometimes. And I also work a lot with sound. I have a degree also in composition and sound practise and fine art. I'm kind of in between the world performance installation and more and more interventional and like public spaces and also some educational practises. I'll leave it at that. 
-10.120792388916016;3.3735179901123047;3;Yes, I think I think I think I'm going to have to. On if someone arrives later. No, I think that's that's everyone. Thanks again. So for those of you who arrived later, I'm reintroduced to myself. My name is Marcin. I'm a composer, sound artist and programmer. I didn't say I'm based in Berlin. Usually right now I'm in Poland visiting my parents. So. So that's what.] I'm talking to you. From today. Let me test one thing to see if I'm able to like to transmit what's on my screen and sound from my computer simultaneously as I speak, because that's that's what I'm mostly going to do tonight. Sure sounds. Mark. Oh. 
12.363042831420898;-13.468941688537598;3;So does anyone have experience in sharing screen and audio on the new Mac M1 computer? For some reason, I can't.  It doesn't happen automatically together when you. Will no. Longer. It's like it's the zoom is asking me to go to my preferences. I mean, look, if that's the case, I can set up computers. But let me try one more time. That's a new thing because that kind of like previous said and have just oh okay so maybe screen and. That's something else. Maybe you need to be a co-host to be able to do it. No, no, no. No, no. It's. It's the. Screen. Screen recordings.  I have to leave the meeting and come back. So just give me a second, okay? Just to make sure that the date. Okay. I'm back. Let's try again. Yes. Okay. So now it's. 
12.50096321105957;-13.407556533813477;3;Okay.  Can you see my screen? Okay. And now. I don't think you can hear anything because I can't hear anything. A new chest. Did you hear it? Okay. So let me think. Martin, sorry to interrupt. There must be at least there was an option for Sarah. Song in the bottom left corner of the cellar window. Uh. And like you mean on the zoom share.  Some of the zoom share options. So yeah. I mean, look, okay, so. Wants multiple phones sharing options. I think you'll have to leave the sharing option and then try it again.  That's yeah. I mean, I did that when I was when I went into the shower screen. That is like, yeah, sure. Sound at the bottom. I clicked that but let me just see. 
17.93397331237793;7.351261615753174;3;Is your output said on the settings. Definitely to I'm just saying I know you know it but sometimes it's not automatic. Yeah. Yeah I know. Like so, so well on the one thing which is different now is there used to be a different output called Zoom audio. Audio. It's not here. For some reason, like on my system system output but I can that's the case. I can I will unplug my but then yeah, like I would, I would go without my headphones. So let me just try one more thing and then. If it says it's my case because I have this headphones on, try one more thing and then. 
4.3701066970825195;28.411893844604492;3;Oh yes. Sorry, I've got I've got audio Zoom audio. So let's let's reboot this. Okay. So could you hear like clicks? Okay, that's good. So let me let me try now with the with the good sound and and vision. So we have this sound. Okay. That's all old people. And you can see things on my screen. Yeah. Okay, perfect. Okay. So the thing I want to talk about is mainly the thing you see on my screen, which is a computer programme I have developed over the past six years as part of my doctoral research at Edinburgh University in Scotland. The programme is called The New Generator. I will give you a kind of a short introduction and then will demonstrate the basics of how the programme. You know, operates what are the kind of basic elements of the of the sound synthesis model? And while doing this, I'll also try to incorporate kind of broader discussion around different ways of, of, of of of formalised sound with, with relation to like some historical, historical documents and also in relation to the way the kind of digital domain understands sounds, sound, and this kind of basic as a kind of basic physical phenomenon. 
2.52376127243042;27.24785804748535;3;To Start a kind of quick introduction about the programme, I have like some slides, but I'm not going to open the like the full slide. So just can just we're going to open the next few images so you can maybe. See the a. B here. Can you see this? Okay. So the and the kind of. Basic like you don't worry about this description here you can read it, but we can talk about it later when I demonstrate the programme because then you would have a chance to kind of ask me questions and so. On. Can the programme operate. 
-4.118958473205566;29.49704360961914;3;With this very kind of short segments of signal, which could be that they could represent sound. Or. Of they could be just like short segments of of drawing. They are really. Short. They are like milliseconds long. So on. On the kind of individual level, they are not audible or they are only audible as a very brief click. Only the repetition of these of these of these short events. Gives Rise to the the stream, which is audible and generates or synthesises. The the sound We hear The name those are like for the for the sound synthesis comes from the the from the astrophysical object also called pulsar, which rotates at. A Kind of stable frequency. But then there are a lot of different pulsars and, and in the universe and each of them rotates at a different frequency. 
-2.039503574371338;31.276655197143555;3;Some of them rotate that frequency, which is audible, other, other kind of steady pulse, kind of rhythmic and discrete, almost like a clock. Sometimes pulsars are called clocks, kind of, you know, the cosmic clocks, which can which kind of give this a steady pace to measure other phenomena in the in the universe. So some of these pulsars emit this pulses of very irregular kind of discrete pace, which you can, you know, distinguish as a steady rhythm. And some of them rotate so quickly that you don't perceive or you like or not answer. But these are the instruments which detect pulsars. They don't perceive the individual pulses, but perceive like a kind of continuous noise or continuous. 
-4.061427593231201;26.456892013549805;3;Tone as such. Because the rotation of of of the pulsar is so fast and the pulses are being fired so quickly that they kind of. You know. MASH up or melt into each other. So the name of the of the sound synthesis method comes from that, from that astrophysical phenomena. I didn't invent the name. I didn't invent the synthesis technique. It has been invented by Professor Curtis Rhodes. He's a. Quite significant figure in computer music, outside of computer music tutorial, which. Is probably the Bible of computer music research. And he has conceptualised the synthesis method and mid-nineties. And then in 2001, together with another researcher back to the Campo, they released the first software implementation of the of the synthesis method called Pulsar Generator. I'm not going to go too much into the details of that release, but one interesting aspect of that release was that the programme was written for for the Macintosh OS nine operation system and. 
-0.36926814913749695;29.601579666137695;3;Only. Two months after the release. Apple kind of changed the whole architecture of the operating system and moved to this OS OS ten architecture. So within two months, the kind of software became obsolete. You know, that's a kind of unfortunate history, but also, you know, that kind of made it less available. Saying this, the computer programme played quite a significant role in kind of emerging then in 2001 and the early, early 2000 emerging computer music scene and artists such as Florian Hecker, Markus Mettler and Russell Haswell, they all used that software to produce this quite, quite characteristic type of sound, which is you're going to hear it, obviously, but but like to to kind of describe it, you know, it sounds very inhuman, but it also also sounds sounds quite organic and and quite quite similar to. 
2.231003761291504;35.66667938232422;3;To. To human voice, which kind of, you know, like places this the sound synthesis in between this kind of domain of kind of abstract. Kind of. Formal model of of of of synthesising sound and and and this kind of physical modelling, which is kind of, you know, emulating kind of known, known sounds and and kind of, you know, timbres of of of of kind of instruments or voice and that in that instance. So that kind of basic element of the of that sense, this model is this this combination of these two really brief signals. One is called Pulsar the Right Way Forward, which you have on this left side on the on the diagram. And the other one is called an envelope. And the kind of formal relationship between them is a simple multiplication. I'm going to show you this soon on the programming side. How? How how post-Soviet as a kind of synthetic object is being composed. And this is this is basically kind of the kind of first level of composition when when, when, when I composed with this with this synthesis method, this to to compose that that micro object. And you will see. 
-3.112820625305176;30.474088668823242;3;Also.In the way the the software is designed. And in a way, it's, it approaches the composition, compositional, processed foods, quite a lot of emphasis on different temporal scales. So you can consider this this really micro microscopic sound as this kind of first level. Then the next level is repetition of these. So these small segments, which kind of moves us into kind of domain of, you know, microseconds and a few seconds. And then by constructing another another like another formalism, on top of that, we arrive at kind of larger structures. Up to 2 minutes. But we're going to talk about it more. While while we're. 
-4.386236190795898;32.746578216552734;3;Looking at the programme. So we have this, this kind of basic, basic fundamental object, which is then repeated and the kind of the. That object to within the syntax synthesis model is called Pulsar Train. You can also call it Pulsar Pulsar Stream, which is basically. A. Repetition of these small pulses in time. What's interesting about. This synthesis model that both the the of waveform and envelope could. B. Of different shape and this could be Changed. While synthesis is being, you know around the way in the sense where the synthetic processes being being, you know, in action and also. So It's kind of another layer of of of control which which may mean make not sense now to you. But when when I played, I will I'll explain to you is this ability to control the rate of emission. So how often you are playing and this process can be controlled independently from the. 
-2.097987651824951;33.429019927978516;3;The the width or the size of the pulse. You can see it's kind of on this on this on this diagram that each of these pulses happens exactly at the same time, but they have different space and varying the size of the pulse has a quite has a quite quite significant effect. On what's what's audible. And and also it makes the that this, you know, this synthesis technique quite powerful to produce this. Quite dynamic varying sound textures kind of look moving seamlessly from from if rhythmic patterns to kind of continuous tone and noise textures. Maybe you have noticed that there are already quite simple formal procedures happening. So the first level is when we are constructing the the pulse and by by multiplying that waveform and an envelope, we are doing a very simple multiplication of two sets of values. Now, I move to now from this from this kind of formal explanation to to closer to the kind of computational processes which are happening. So we are basically multiplying two sets of values to arrive. 
-3.19328236579895;33.62566375732422;3;At The first first object, which is the postscript. The next kind of formal procedure is basically addition. We are streaming one pulse after the other. We are adding them in time. So I tend. To look at my compositional process. As As as these kind of simple formal, formal procedures of addition, multiplication, subtraction, division and so on between different data formats and values. Let's move to the software. So. One one thing to look to, to demonstrate as a kind of first the first kind of step to understand how this into a sense of of of of of pulsars operates is to look at the kind of basic construction of the of the threat. So. I've spoken about the post-earthquake form and the envelope as these two objects which are multiplied to to arrive at the. 
-6.095602512359619;32.07449722290039;3;At The other, the kind of like the basic basic pose which is done repeated. So in this and this programme, you can see all of these tables, they all look the same. And this Is all this also reflects the kind of object oriented approach to composition, but also object oriented approach to programming that, you know. 
-6.21314811706543;32.796875;3;The object itself. Can be can have the same shape. So, for example, we can have the same the same shape within. I will just open the bigger window. We can have the same kind of shape here. But this shape has different meaning or has different function depends on which table is being placed within. And that's that's kind of, you know, the aspect of, of, of object oriented programming approach or object oriented kind of design approach, which is called polymorphism, which basically means that, you know, the same object can. 
5.650121212005615;29.96832847595215;3;Play. A different role or has a different function depends on the context and and the kind of relationship to which which is being put into it. So let's, let's, let's just, you know, generate like a simple, simple way from so maybe, maybe actually not that simple. We'll just get this kind of noisy one sort here. This facility. Okay. So we have this kind of like, you know. Noisy thing happening sort of statistically, you know, going from. From. Up here to down there. Uh, so this is the waveform. Then we can generate an envelope and maybe here get something, like, way simpler. So we will see the relationship between two. So maybe this is sort of the kind of Gaussian bell shaped function. So the basic, basic operation between these two is multiplication. So let me go here and. 
4.237330913543701;33.84383773803711;3;Down here because I can see them. Okay. So I'm just retrieving that data from that, from the programme. So this is the waveform. This is the envelope in. So you've probably noticed that these both of these objects already have certain formal qualities. You know, there is this. Kind of. View of of of of. Computational approach to the composition of sound composition of sound synthesis. Now that's it's kind of synthesising sounds out of nothing that you you kind of almost construct sound from just like basic principles, like almost like samples. Which often isn't true. So, like, in this context, you know, the kind of the basic element of, of, of what I'm dealing with as a composer already has certain formal dimensions. You know, like each of these objects, you know, functions within within. 
-0.8344725370407104;32.908958435058594;3;A. Particular set of values. So you could see the, you know, this this set of of values, you know, functions between minus one and one. And you can without doing any heavy statistical analysis, you can say that, okay, it starts somewhere above or around 0.5 and it kind of statistically moves towards minus one. And there are probably more than 2000 values that are exactly 2048 values because I know it. But, you know, without knowing it, just reading this this graph, you can you can already say that these objects possess particular formal qualities which which are given, you know, they are not. Of course, it's a matter of my choice. Like I've chosen to like to to look to, to work with this particular sets of values. But the range of these values that it's always -1 to 1 and it's always 2048, it's always there. So these are already kind of formal limitations, which, which as a composer working with, with, with computers I'm dealing with or, you know, and I can either ignore it and kind of like not bother about these things or I can engage with these formal processes and kind of approach them as a as a as a creative constrain. And also in terms of the the other object, the envelope we see. Also like a particular, you know, statistically distributed set of values. 
-3.734341859817505;34.50501251220703;3;Between. Zero and one. I mean, there is another another range. I mean, that these all of these objects are between minus one and one. But obviously, this one only has a values between zero and one. So we don't see anything below because there are no values there. So we have these two objects. And then the combination of these two objects, the kind of multiplication between them. Composition of these two objects constructs. An object of positive. Let's see it. So this is the pulse of it. So the. Multiplication of these two gives us this pulse and a very brief, noisy pulse. And it's mainly because, you know, we had zero values until around here. So you can see there is nothing hardly any any values happening until here. And that's where the kind of the shape of the envelope rises up. 
-4.500282287597656;33.85213088989258;3;To kind of. You know, allows other values to pass through. So we could think about envelope as this kind of a self, which, you know, you know, mutes or cancels centre certain values, certain values or allows certain values to pass through. And this is the basic object. What we then. Hear in. As a sound is repetition of this object at a particular rate. So let's, let's start the programme. So what we what. What we hear now is one of these pulses. Per second. Can I ask a question so quickly?  Yeah, sure.  Did you say so? Does so, then? The envelope multiply said the waveform is a multiplication. 
20.28011703491211;6.569787979125977;3;Yeah, it's a multiplication. Yep.  Okay. And that and their function is. Is there always like a multiplication? Always. It's all the composer chooses. It's like that. Well, well. And this. In this case, it has to be a multiplication. But, you know, like, we could. We could. We could see what would happen if we were to divide. Yeah, I was just wondering. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.  So. Okay, so what we have now was we have this one click happening every every 1/2. And as I said, you know, the the kind of like the one of the characteristic aspects of the synthesis method is this ability to kind of, you know, to move from, from, from this discrete. 
-2.5395193099975586;32.10527420043945;3;Uh. Mode to. To something which is can turn all that noisy. What usually happens is kind of between 35 pulses per second and 45 where we no longer hear. But we no longer hear pulses. But we hear.  A kind of continuous stream of, of, of, of like kind of like tonal or or a kind of noisy, noisy texture. And you've seen on this on this one of this diagrams here that the rate of emission can be controlled independently from the of the width of the of the pulse. And this is kind of another another powerful aspect of the of the synthesis method where we could. While we can keep the same frequency, the rate of emission, which in this context is called fundamental frequency, because that analysis that corresponds to the fundamental frequency of the of of of sound and change the change to the width of the of the pulse. It's better. It's audible the way better with other types of sounds and of less less noise. So if I, if I just create a different Postlethwaite form. 
7.732665061950684;33.87360763549805;3;In a way, for those of you who. Work with sounds like this this effect resembles kind of filtering of pulses and and kind of early electronic music and like 19, 1950s in the. In. In the studio in Cologne, one of the first studios which was equipped and like. You know. With the analogue filters and the sound tone oscillators. The technique of kind of generating pulses and then filtering them like, you know, like putting on the high frequencies of low frequencies was quite, quite a quite often used technique, compositional technique. But in this circuit and in the way the programme is constructed, there is no filter. You know, we could have achieved the same effect simply by changing the the, you know, the size of the object. So it's here it is again, another type of formalism. They basically, you know, like kind of like either squeezing or like diluting dilating or like compressing, compressing the set of values. 
-5.784377098083496;33.08880615234375;3;So in here. Already you have this. In a shift from one temporal domain to another. You know, we'll be composed this kind of micro micro object, which is which is repeated at a certain rate. And we are playing that object at a particular particular rate, which is then controllable by us. And the size of that object can be also changed while the system is generating the streams continuously. So you could you could see that there are like different, different temporal levels. But each which of these each of these levels is its interface to the same kind of object. And this. 
-5.1194257736206055;25.559490203857422;3;Is Obviously an aesthetic choice, but also it links back to, again, this, this approaches to composition, which which have have, you know, the roots and the kind of early computer music of of the colonial school, which I already mentioned. Composers such as Stockhausen, Karlheinz Stockhausen or Michel Koenig. Also a Belgian guy whose surname I always having problem to pronounce forwards. I can I can probably find his his name and you can you can you can see if I'm not pronouncing it correctly. But like this, this group of composers and early fifties attempted to kind of find. 
-2.364881992340088;29.87555503845215;3;And. Have one formal procedure. To. To apply to to all objects which can be composed and computer music or electronic music. Studio.  So they try to approach, approach like, you know, the frequency or the pitch of the of the composition, the rhythm, the spatial position of objects with the same kind of formal procedure. But of course, such a kind of unified approach had it had its problems. And and that's why a lot of these compositions sound quite. Kind of pure and away from from like from from our our perspective, but also those days. They sound quite cold and and. More. 
6.304080009460449;34.16313552856445;3;Like a like a kind of exercise or or a kind of a demonstration of a particular formalism, rather than than looking like a fully developed compositions. And often, often these these these compositions data were called like studies rather than composition one or two or whatever they were called studies. And probably because they were just studies to kind of exemplify how such a form of is, can be, can be signified or like, you know, presented via a kind of compositional process. What's interesting and the kind of like current approaches is that, uh, the formalism to, uh, to, to kind of approach sound at this different temporal levels doesn't come from some abstract, uh, abstract domain as it used to be in the fifties. But it comes from this, you know, very essence of the, you know, of the kind of computational processes, uh, which deal with sound. So, so, so this kind of formalism is closely linked to, to, to the way sound is represented to us within the digital domain and, and in the way that allows, allows it to be, uh, you know, audible as something more than just like a kind of called, uh, kind of formalist exercise and, and, and just like trying out different, different kind of abstract approaches to the composition. And. 
-5.880571365356445;26.650592803955078;3;Saying this little, little, you know, another digression. Uh. We could think about at least two ways the sound can be represented not only in the digital domain, but also in a, and the kind of analytic approach. One is the approach which was developed by. In the 19th century by actually the 17th century by freer and the. Kind of. 
-5.700504302978516;28.604934692382812;3;Basic, basic approach of of of of of of furrier was to obviously he was in working with digital sound and because it wasn't, it was impossible he wasn't even working with with sound. He was working with heat. But he proposed this analysis tool which could decompose any complex function into constituent sound tones for sound functions. I can actually show it to you and the programme how, how, how this kind of formalism would look like. And also to require me to tape a little bit. But you could think about. You know. Simple. 
-14.916688919067383;25.913700103759766;3;Sin function and maybe let's get like 3 seconds of it. It's going to take a little bit of time, too. So we have this function which, you know, so there are 12, 12. Oscillations per second. And we have 3 seconds of of of of that of that function. Let's have another function. Maybe now something, you know, like the numbers don't really matter here. It's also 3 seconds of this, and before this one. Gets.  Generated, I will generate another one with a really slow oscillation. So like one one cycle per second and we have.  Three and a. Half, 3 Seconds of it. 
-14.935200691223145;25.905385971069336;3;So we have like, you know, three, three functions. One generates like 2243 or 235, them being delivered to the 234 cycles per second one. Another one is one cycle per second and then is 12 cycles per second. So we have this again, it's like another formalism by like how can we construct a complex function? So the basic approach would be. Two. Add them together. So. 12. 
-5.495981216430664;28.076446533203125;3;Added to 200 4834 and this added to one. So what? What what what we've done just now is to kind of reverse for your analysis what Syria was saying, that if you have a signal like this, you can decompose it into. Any amount of constituent functions. So in theory, what you are saying that you could by analysing this sound or by by running a like endless set of, of, of sine functions on top of this one, you would be able to kind of decompose it into this, but not not necessarily into these three functions we have in here, but into a can of constituent functions, which then allows you to, you know, to, to manipulate that sound better or to, to, to recompose it and so on. And to. Like to hear what we just did. I will play you each of these functions. And then are we going to play the. The result. 
-15.458394050598145;25.453264236450195;3;So first function, let me just turn the speaker for maybe that loud bit. This one is really you know, you can hardly hear it. Obviously, you won't hear it because it's 12. Of cycles per second, you know, it will have to be higher to teach you that you can you may hear this like a little. Occur that I have this. I can hear that he. But you know, 12 cycle cycles per second is below our our kind of hearing ranges would have to be 20. At least this one will be audible. It's all. This one won't be eligible because it's just one one cycle per second. So yeah, it's there is something there. But because the, but when you add all of these together. 
19.81059455871582;6.068854808807373;3;It could ask the question what is, what is the cycle. Because it relates, oh yeah, yeah. So yeah, so the cycle is like is that one of like so like when the, when the start or when the signal moves from 0 to 1. Okay, cut cuts, cuts to zero again and then goes back to two one. So this is the cycle here. I don't know if you see my mouse. Yeah. This one cycle. Yeah. So and obviously like cycle one interval. Yeah, yeah. So like so yeah. So one interval. So like when, when, when the function starts cuts, cuts to like cuts through zero and then goes back to zero. But obviously this is, this is purely abstract kind of formal representation like in reality sounds do not start you don't start with zero and do not like you know they are not regular. 
-15.999605178833008;24.949949264526367;3;But it de because you said you could you knew that 12 cycles would not be enough for us to hear. Yeah, well, so that's. How do you know? Well, that's that's because. 
7.944826602935791;28.4558048248291;3;The Range of, of of of what we hear is like from 20  Hertz and 1212 basically corresponds to Hertz or Hertz's the measurement of like cycles per second. So like it corresponds to APM. So yeah. And it corresponds to like to like to also to our range of hearing. So we could see, we could hear things like from 20 hertz. Above. Up to like I don't, I don't know exactly what's the, what's the, what's that was there. And so I think it's like. Uh. The thousands of parents to the kind of upper.  Upper.  Range. But then when we add all of these together, then we are going to get the, you know, the kind of complex sound.  So this is this. 
8.530174255371094;31.01485252380371;3;Is one way to like to represent sound. And the problem of of this representation is that it's really good at a kind of reconstructing this regular sounds like in here. So we have this sounds which. Are you know. I kind of like the the constituent elements of or objects of of of that of that complex sound can be. Can be represented by just like regular functions, but problem with with the silence and the reality or like a lot of sounds of like instrumental, uh, origins is that they are not regular and they have kind of more noise and, and like, and this, this approach is unable to capture that kind of information. And the problem of, of that is and, and, you know, we can, we can maybe talk about it later. But, you know, there is this. 
-9.409244537353516;28.74452781677246;3;Problem.  Of capturing something. At the precise moment and being able to establish a value of that thing in that moment. And in a way, it's a it's a it's an example of this uncertainty principle.  Where You can either say that something happens at precise moment or you could say, what is the value of that thing? But you are unable to say that, you know, the time where that thing is happening to look to to explain it a bit better. I'll show you this other graph. Which is basic basic representation of of sound and digital domain.  And there. And. So you see. Here. The functions I showed you are a bit a bit misleading because what you've seen, you've seen this continuous, continuous set of values while in reality, computer doesn't. Doesn't see or doesn't doesn't doesn't have a continuous like concept of continuity as such. Like everything is quantised, everything is discrete. So all of these functions we just looked at are sampled at a regular interval, and the sampling in audio is related to the sampling frequency. 
-9.271809577941895;29.27805519104004;3;So the, the frequency of like how, how often your computer is, is looking for the value and generates it. But in terms of analysis, the problem of being able to say that the the function has a particular value at the particular time is that if I, if I go closer to negative to to to explained, it's kind of like, you know, clearly. You need more than one value to be able to say what is the value of that one thing? And in order to to know values of other things surrounding that that that value, you already move away from the, you know, from the from the kind of temporal region you are looking at. 
-9.53267765045166;28.989898681640625;3;So you can say that, you know, at this moment, this value, this like this thing or this object, this sample has a value of, let's say one. I mean, you can say that it has a value of one, but you can't say that. You can't say, what moment is that? Because you need the preceding value at the following value at the same time. But when you if you if you look at preceding and following value, then you are already moving from the temporal window you are interested in. So so there is this problem and sound analysis and computer computational approach to sound that that you either. Have precision in frequency or you have precision in time. And the the the analysis I've just showed you is the analysis, which is really concerned with the with the frequency domain of, of, of sound. 
1.064042329788208;31.359920501708984;3;So how many cycles are per second and so on? But at the same time it did neglect the timing information and in the way that the way we listen and the way a lot of a lot of instrumental sounds are, are, you know, kind of synthesised, uh, the time timing information on the kind of temporal level of, of information is significant for for us to distinguish the sound of trumpet from the sound of, of, uh, of a string instrument, you know, that an analysis they could, they could look very similar. But then the timing of, of, of, of events, you know, the chance and the kind of like the, the way the sound starts, which can be kind of cannot be captured through this further analysis is quite, quite important. And that's where, you know, and other types of analysis were developed. And one of these approaches has been developed in. 
3.188523292541504;31.39312744140625;3;Talking about town by.  Yeah. Tumblr. Yeah. So this is what actually cannot cannot be shown through this is it?  No, no.  It's kind of it's not like Tom Brady. Like and also also Tom Brady is something more than just just frequency and time. You know, Tom Brady like we get we can talk about it later. I think that's that's that's the kind of like that's another topic. But but but like to to get closer to analysis of Tom Brady. You cannot rely only on frequency information. You need to you need to also incorporate other aspects of of sound analysis, including the the temporal analysis. And that's why and and the forties and fifties. The British. Scientists then is Gabor had to introduce another way to look at sound and then he kind of conceptualised this object of acoustical quanta where he decided to, to look at sound and that kind of signal not as a kind of continuous development of of waveforms, but as the. 
4.034327507019043;34.90363311767578;3;The kind of discrete. Send them to, you know, to a like set of values. So he he has been dividing the signal into short segments and then analysing the sound within these short segments. Obviously, problem with his analysis was that he was able to to to to precisely say that, you know, what is the kind of time what is happening in time within this short segment. But then he wasn't able to to to predict the kind of frequency development. So the kind of. What. I'm trying to say that these two approaches are not.  They shouldn't be. Approached as as kind of alternatives, but more as a kind of complementary ways to look at sounds. So you could you know, you could think about sound in terms of of this kind of duality between wave and and particle. And also it relates to, you know, the way we now know kind of sound operates the same as a light like within these two realms that it can be approached as a wave based phenomena, but also as a this kind of particle or corpuscular phenomena at the same time. But the problem is, like you, you can you can either analyse it as one or the other. You know, that's, you know, that's not a kind of operating within one realm or the other. 
-6.5720672607421875;29.702383041381836;3;So that. Was like a quick, quick digression.  To. Go back to the programme. You probably noticed that the programme operates. As this kind of experimental synthesis of these two approaches, because on one hand, you have these really short segments of sound, but then within those segments that I'm able to kind of construct this waveform, so especially that waveform. Can.  Be constructed using this, this function and here. Which is called. Foria and again, like because it basically a Foria approach. So what I'm doing and here I have 16 set of values from 0 to 1 and each of these values represents a assigned function. So, so one, if I just set one value, the first value to the top to the maximum level, I'll have just one cycle of a of assign tone or assign value, assign a function. I often mix, you know, tones and functions. You know, in this basic form, a level is just a function that doesn't have a sonic meaning yet it becomes sound when it's, you know, synthesised by the, by the, by the programme. If I add another cycle then we're going to have. 
3.504929542541504;30.35202407836914;3;Two of these. The combination of one and two, because that's basically the the second is here. So then we have combination of these two. I'm just what I'm doing, like I'm constructing the function here. I'm copying and pasting it here. But then you could do something kind of more complex. So that's the that's the function. And let's leave the the the envelope as it was. So the programme tries to combine this like different or account for this different ways. Sound is represented like in both computational domain but also in and the kind of like kind of broader domain or of of sound analysis or acoustics. And and I remember when I, when I start working with, with computers, like composing music. It was many years ago, 2001, I think. 
-18.32063865661621;4.621976375579834;3;Yeah. The one. Problem for me, or maybe not a problem, but one thing which which which which constantly. You know. I've been questioning is this aspect of of of getting computer programmes being written as this kind of closed entity. So someone is designing a piece of software for you. I'm just. Are you still There, guys? 
4.453790187835693;36.43671798706055;3;Because I'm kind of not sure if I lost you. Oh, no, you have that. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, okay. I was I was worried that because no one was moving was like, really? Okay, cool. So one of the problems I encountered while the while, you know, kind of working with, with computers for, for sound synthesis is that, uh, the majority of computer programmes are this kind of designed as this kind of closed entities, you know, that someone is designing a. Programme for sound synthesis, and it allows you to, you know, to play with these values and so on, and that's it, you know. So you're kind of like so so there is there is a there is a constrain which is not which is not bad because there are always constraints. Even, you know, as I as I explained at the beginning, there is a, you know, formal constraint. And in the way, you know, these objects I'm working with are are kind of placed like what are their, you know, what are the kind of size and the range of values, you know? So there are always a constraint. But the problem for me was that the. Often. The kind of formal or kind of compositional. Kind of like ideals of the of the designer wherein very. Clearly a Kind of explained so so. You you. 
6.7094597816467285;35.34435272216797;3;Kind of have to accept someone is telling you that's what it's there to be composed and that said you know and how does it relate to like to you know, to to theory or to like to to to acoustics and so on. This is something quite, quite important for me. But it wasn't, you know, kind of easy to to grasp from the programmes written by other people. So I decided to, you know, to, to, to learn how to programme and how to, how to like work with digital sound. And one of the kind of interesting aspects for me while developing this programme, but also like working on other programmes, was to, to have this ability to uh, to enter to, to look at the computer programme, not as a, as a kind of simple functional tool, but also as, as this kind of kind of archaeologist, you know, as like the, the computer programme becomes an archaeologist of, of, of science, you know, by, by incorporating this like different, different views on how sound can be represented by incorporating this.  Um. 
6.124238967895508;35.91346740722656;3;You know, different sensibilities to, to, to how to, you know, how to represent formally compositional process and so on. And you know, this programme is the kind of effect of that kind of approach where, where I try to like write a programme which like what do you see here has the, has the graphic interface. So in a way it is closed entity. But at the same time you've seen me like, like you know what the playing with the programme by using the, the computer programme programming language which kind of you know allows. The programme to be rewritten and, and, you know, to be used in this kind of flexible, kind of almost like a feedback feedback situation where. Well, you know, a lot of this object is going to be redefined and then kind of interrogated while being, you know, used in composition. So it's not only A tool For generating sound, but also it's a it's a kind of, you know, instrument to probe and to to, you know, to. 
-4.6616644859313965;29.34451675415039;3;To Kind of instrumentalize sound theory. And the sound theory I'm trying to instrumentalize in here is this sound theory of the scope audience, this sound theory of acoustical quantile, where we have this kind of short, short segments of sound which are then repeated and, and then can be controlled in different ways. So. I'll pose now and move quickly to, to show you other aspects of the programme so you can, you can hear more than just that repeated click. So there are several values or parameters of the, of the synthesis process which can be, can be controlled from, from the interface. And what, what you what you hear now is this thing which is changing in time only when I interact with the software. 
-5.385204315185547;32.344337463378906;3;But I can also provide the kind of trajectory of of how these parameters are changing in time. And here again, I'm using the same kind of object, this table thing, which which allows me to use the same. Shape of the same function. But, you know, which will produce different effects. And that's, you know, again, like to to to repeat myself, is this this this kind of polymorphic aspect of of the of of the of the programming approach which which allows the same the same object to all the same functions to play different role depends on the context they are placed in. 
6.2630205154418945;31.618574142456055;3;Just trying to Make sure that all we got is we'll get just this one Parameter. I don't want anything else. So we have this thing happening in time, then that can activate, you know, the, the, the rate of emission changing in time. And so let's, let's specify like, you know, maybe 20 seconds over 20 seconds. The the the rate of emission will be the values from this table. So, you know, this is already. Passing. The Perceptual exercise to use the same the same function to drive different values and and perceive, you know, the effect of of or how this, you know, the same kind of the same shape can be can be used in different contexts. He often these sounds are, you know, sounds quite cartoony and like her like. Yeah, I think there is there is a kind of element of, of, of, of humour with that I think I would like to think so we can use the same, the same shape and different in different contexts and also like to like to move into kind of another set of kind of formal procedures which are incorporated within the programme. We talked about this multiplication which happens at the lower level, the addition, which kind of Stream. 
-2.9732425212860107;32.607666015625;3;Is this process and time. And also there's another, another type of addition happening of this kind of top level of the programme. And you could see it here that you have the like three, three columns of basically this. Same the same type of type of volume. We have performance frequency, envelope, timing and amplitude times three. And these are basically the three. Three versions of the same, the same, the same stream. And they are all controlled by the same with the same rate. So firing a pulse. But then these poles can be split into three streams, and within each stream I can make this pulse to be, you know, narrow or stretch it. The same pulse can be placed on the left hand side of the speaker or on the right or the middle or somewhere in between. And it can have a different amplitude. And being able to continue to produce this, this kind of various texture, this is quite powerful, I think. So let me just play you three of these pulses together. 
11.070335388183594;33.69353485107422;3;And. And. Ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow. So if you've noticed it, it begins to sound like a really cheap sound, like speech synthesis. So the, you know, the the the the sounds, the sound that the synthesis method has this. Uh. Almost like, like a voice kind of qualities which, you know, as I mentioned earlier, like it is very like, it's like inherently. Digital. As none of these, you know, these functions here are sampled sounds. They are like they are, they are they are like mathematical functions. But also, you know, the kind of the combination and the kind of formalism of the of the of the way the synthesis is being defined makes it sound like like little like human voice or. So that's the kind of over your overview of the programme to, to like to show you a little bit more of the, of the other things you can do with it. And I don't know, like if. 
12.58627986907959;32.939266204833984;3;If, like. If I gotta and I had mentioned to like, you know, after the demonstration, like I'm like I can, I can send you the copy of the programme. It is a bit fiddly to install it because it's, it's a standalone thing and, but it's possible to, to run it. So if any of you is interested in using the programme, I'm happy to share it with you. So just to show you like kind of other range of sounds you can, you can generate from the, the. From the. Programme are like a set of modulators also. I will I will send the of the link so that you can you can download it. I've got also like a standalone version of the programme, not, not exactly this one, but the earlier version which might be easier to like to work with. So you could, you could. You could hear the kind of variety of sounds like that being generated from the same kind of like principle by just repeating the short kind of short function and time. But yeah, so that's. 
5.428128242492676;34.245243072509766;3;Kind of The basic mechanism of the, of the programme and. To. Kind of like stop. Price, but also bring it back again into this idea of of of of kind of temporalities, which I kind of suggest that as a as a kind of overarching theme of, of of of my work, but also that the the work the to the tonight's presentation. I think it like temporality and this kind of broad meaning is the most most important aspect of my work like on several levels like the one level is this level of what I'm engaged with as a, as a, as a composer. Like I'm engaged with this, with this objects which are. Which function on different temporal levels. So you could think about things like pulsar, waveform and envelope as a brief, short silence, then post the stream as this something which is kind of longer and already you know, that we are able to perceive it to the kind of composition compositional level where I'm like, you know, generating this kind of sounds developing in time. So you already have this kind of progression of, of, of different temporal levels. But also there is there's another aspect of kind of temporality, which is probably closer to this. Discursive meaning of of temporality like to think about the origins of particular tools. So for example, like by me being engaged with this particular sound synthesis technique, I'm not only engaged with, you know, what's with its sound or with, with the, with the interface, but also by designing this tool I've been looking at previous. 
-4.050776481628418;25.76482582092285;3;To the  Incarnation of the, of the same technique. So there is this kind of archive, almost archival archaeological aspects to my work where I work with resource resources from the past. And those resources could be. You know. Academic texts, computer software, the kind of manuals, the source code of the, of the, of, of, of programmes, but also like recordings done with the previous versions of the, of the, of the sound synthesis technique. 
1.8390231132507324;29.259550094604492;3;So there is this. Yeah. Kind of archival work, kind of that aspect of of my of my, of my research, but also like my composition. Like I tend to think about my composition as a, as a, as a, as a, as a research method to but also. In the context of temporalities, you know, like thinking about this kind of one. One arrow pointing to the past. There is this kind of projection to the future also. And, you know, and that projection can be seen in the fact that the programme is open source and has been used by a kind of new, new wave of, of artists and, and composers to produce new works and also to. Uh. 
2.8946263790130615;30.370380401611328;3;To like, to build new versions of the software based on this one. So, so, so there is this another aspect of temporality which I'm interested in this. Not so much historical but discursive, you know, like temporality, which kind of links kind of past knowledge and aesthetics with what they were towards and what happens currently. And also kind of projects that are allows these tools to be used and projected in the in the future. I think that's that's that's that's not that destructive to to levels of temporality and then maybe to look to. To wrap up and then give you some chance to like to to to ask me questions. I will go back to something I wanted to show you as a as a first diagram, but it looks like we're going to end up with it's this diagram of multiple temporalities. And in terms of of what we talked about, in terms of the like the the composition of and composition with digital sound, there are like few of these levels are quite important, especially towards the top. You have this kind of second, second slice. From the top you have this supra micro mazor sound object and micro level. 
-4.24993896484375;31.097681045532227;3;And what we hope. The way the programme operates, it kind of operates from this bottom. Up to the top. So we start with this micro level. We moved the sound object. You could think about the pulse of earth, the composition of the way form and the and the envelope of the sound object. Then you have this mezzo level which operates on the level of of several seconds, and then the macro level is the level of a of a composition. Obviously, the the programme itself doesn't stop you or doesn't stop the user to, to compose with it. And I composed a few pieces it just with this programme. But. It is also a tool to generate material which then can be processed and further developed as a composition and kind of an external software or using external external procedures. Interesting. In this in this this whole diagram of of of temporality is the, you know, the. The kind of temporality of the kind of conscious now, the kind of the present and its sets according to Reclaim we can see it in here is it's roughly 600 milliseconds. 
8.669612884521484;36.77989196777344;3;So there are this, you know, I often come back to this diagram to like to think. Where are the processes engaged with in terms of their temporality, you know, and do these processes, you know? Kind of, you know, operate within a particular time window, you know, what is the time window? You know? And I often question these processes like to gain more understanding. To to to also, like, you know, like to be able to, uh. To get elected, elected to account, the better for, you know, what are my materials and what are the tools I'm working with as a composer that I don't take? Especially like, you know, with, with with the digital sound, I don't take these things as granted. I tend. 
-2.014166831970215;27.402116775512695;3;To Interrogate the kind of origins of these of these objects and and how they, you know, force me to think in certain way and to compose in a certain way. And obviously, you can extend this argument to, you know, to any medium, you know, like composing on paper. Often like, you know, mediates the composition of the process and in a particular way composing on a on a digital audio workstation, it forces you forces the user to to conceptualise the composition of the process in a particular way. 
2.256455421447754;27.3916072845459;3;And By being able to kind of to programme this, this, this or to design this programme on my own. And. And also by. By approaching it not only as. As a kind of. As a visual thing, but also as a, as this kind of like basic structure of programming language that I'm able to, you know, to duck, to question or like re-evaluate my my way of of composing and which I think I will pose now, because I've been talking for for a bit now, and I will give you time to to ask questions. Thank you so much for letting. I guess it will take some time for us to digest. 
13.737253189086914;32.30824661254883;3;And of course, I mean, look, I'm I'm I'm aware.  Because that, you know, the the group is quite, quite the big and everyone has a different different. Ways of working and different like my brain is already shutting down. So that works with different materials. You know, like.  It's like, I don't know how, how, how useful, like not using that programme would be for you, but you know, like if. You are, you know. If you want to use it and you want to install it on your computer and just play around with it, I'm happy.  To to. Assist anyone.  Sure. I can ask a technical question. Yeah. So, um, does the programme take external commands? Like could you control the policy for instance, because that could open up lots of other words at the start. I mean like you stop using as you programme the radio. Yeah. Yeah. 
13.244105339050293;32.640174865722656;3;Like it's like so the programme is written in Supercollider, which is a kind of audio specific programming environment. And you can, you can send any, any data into it from anywhere like, from like, you know, sensor from like a MIDI controller. Um, so there is, yeah, you can, you can control it any way you want and also you can reprogramme it if you, if you know how to programme. 
-4.2296271324157715;-4.320205211639404;3;Yeah, because. Yeah. As you said, it's sort of. Works as. As a piece in a puzzle and. Yeah. So it's good days, open source and accessible because then someone else takes it further to another place. Yeah. I mean, that was almost always my intention from the beginning because the original programme, the one written in 2001, I was an open source. And an also interesting fact is that the source code for the original programme was lost so only two years ago. So like I. 
0.8602995872497559;25.48051643371582;3;Like I managed to like to programme my own version based on this, the resources which were available like so the, the programme manual and, and like few texts, academic texts kind of like kind of formal analysis of, of the technique. But I didn't have access to the, the source code of the original programme until three years ago. And by that time I already had my own version. So, so it was quite, quite interesting. 
0.8685435056686401;24.192317962646484;3;Yeah. It's kind of quite interesting. A kind of temporal progression of, of the, of the research that the most important resource, which is the, the, the, the, the source code wasn't available to me until the very end of my, of my research project. Which. Yeah. Which makes, it, makes it quite, you know, quite, quite interesting. And I've, yeah, I've written about it in my thesis. Too that you know. The version I arrived at.  Like, you know, like it. 
-1.7458467483520508;26.965761184692383;3;Looked very similar to the original one, but it was programmed totally differently because I didn't know how, like how they programmed it. Like what were the, you know, the solutions inside the programme because you could think about this surface level of the, of the graphic interface and then the kind of deep level of the, of the, of the programming language and the, the, the formalism of that which wasn't available to me. You know. 
19.170644760131836;3.479907512664795;3;This is exactly what you were talking about. Temporalities No. Yeah. Restage Almost starting, like going back to the beginning, but in the middle of it. ] Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And it's like I found it quite, quite interesting, you know, even at the time when, like when we managed to, to find the, the source code of the original programme.  I considered. Temporalities. Yeah.  Yeah. So, so I even considered at the time like maybe I should then open the original one and you know, I'll look into it. But yeah it.  It's, it's, it's, it's.  It was quite, quite interesting process from that, from that perspective to. The. And could you, like run multiple trains? How do you say. At the same time? Yeah. Like so. So makes like a big class. Yeah. So that's. That's what. So when I, when I initialise the programme, I have to say how many instances I want. So what do you see? And here is one, one instance, and then that's another instance. And this is another one. So there are three, but you could have more and you know, you could, you could play them.  Uh. 
4.8424177169799805;31.16656494140625;3; Maybe just get something. Kind of.  Less, less noisy happening. You can have this one stream happening here. And. Have another one. So yeah, you can you can have multiple streams and create and they can be also in the kind of interconnected. But that's. Like from the, from the programmes like from the language side rather than the interface.  Also one. One thing I haven't mentioned like so like I often think about the compositional process as this kind of amount of the I've mentioned that I didn't show all of it like as this kind of progression of different operators. So we have this multiplication, we have the addition kind of happening at various levels, but you could also have a subtraction. And one of the. 
-1.1848875284194946;31.639677047729492;3;Kind of subtractive methods within the within the way programme operates is this method called masking. Like if. When, when, when, when pulses are being played. They they often happen continuously. You know, unless I run the. I'm also around. It's true this the this this other functions. They usually just happen kind of relentlessly all the time. So masking is a is a is a method which kind of mutes selected posters. And you could have different ways of of masking these. One is based on the kind of probability distribution. So if you think about probability as a range of values between zero and one, zero means no pulses and one means always pulses any any value in between generates this stochastic distributed to mask which which masks some pulses as and allows some other pulses to be played. So if I could the value 0.9 I'm going to have this. Generates this almost random, kind of stochastic. Uh. Distribution of pulses. So it kind of like punches holes in the in the stream at this like when whenever the pulses are just like a discrete rhythm, right? Then we get like, you know, different patterns. But when we split it up. You. That's one way of creating the mask. Another way is called the burst, where I specify how many pulses I want to be audible and how many pulses I want to silence. So I can say, let's have like four pulses followed by seven silences. So in this example, you see the kind of subtractive formalism in action. This works quite well with, you know, with the modulation. And then there is another set of. 
-2.7188169956207275;22.96581268310547;3;It's Another another topic for another presentation. This matter that I've been working with quite, quite a lot including recently of I'm working on The chapter on a. Commissions. I don't know if you if you know, a composer, a French Greek composer pianist is in our case, he he died in 2002, but this year will be his hundredth birthday. So he was quite influential for like not only for contemporary kind of experimental classical music, but also. 
4.291130065917969;25.10150718688965;3; For Kind of computer, computer music. So I've been asked to compose a new work for his birthday party, which is going to happen in Berlin in November. And as part of that, that process, I've been developing this method. Of. Working with. With. What kind of compositional structures, which is called sieves and sieves are basically. To to not to open another another big discussion is operate with with sets of integers, integer numbers. And by creating this different sets and combining them through logical operations such as union, intersection, difference and so on, I can generate that, can this, this and this example. And here I can generate different masking sequences. So different sequences of ones and zeros one as opposed zero as as no pulse. So, so I'm defining this surface in here, then I have like a different way of combining them in here. And I can, let's say, like if I use this first, first operation, I can write for this sequence of zeros and ones, and it sounds like this. So it's like it's just another way of creating this whole sequences of, of different kind of symmetry and symmetry. And this, again, sounds quite good with with the modulation. Now. So that's. 
7.24900484085083;32.84021759033203;3;Another. Another kind of like an extension of, of the programme I've been developing and also. Just just came back to my mind this idea of of of of of different temporalities. You could think about. Like all. Of this objects. Like these dysfunctions when they are in this in this state and here, they can exist outside of time, in a sense, because they are nothing but set of values and they only become kind of temporal ized or actualised in time when they are placed in the context of either the, you know, the sort of the waveform envelope or one of these parameters. So there is this, you know, another kind of. Engagement with temporality by approaching these objects as both functioning as outside of time and kind of paralysing them or like and engaging with them as objects in time, which are, you know, part of the of the of the synthetic process. So here is yet another another engagement with the with its temporality and like to like to to maybe, like point you out like some of the. The resources I've been, you know, working with in terms of like, why did I become interested in temporality? Why did I? Decided to. To. Like to look at this particular aspect of of working with with with this with this synthesis tool. There's this. 
-0.21609899401664734;27.62552833557129;3;German. Media archaeology writer full of gang evidenced and and he's his writing was quite influential on my on my work and the way I think about my. Work and. Write about my. Work.  Like he he he looks at the kind of past the media from that from the kind of temporal perspective. And what's really interesting and what really kind of grasped my attention was this. Aspect of of media, including computer software. Not only as objects which exist in temporality, like a particular temporality. Or you know. 
5.261673450469971;35.2474365234375;3;But also but also as objects which are able to generate their own temporalities. And, and, you know, through my work with this software, I discover that, you know, this computer programme isn't only. A. Tool or a kind of functional object, but it's also a kind of generator of, you know. Of.  Kind of new kind of conjectures and new hypotheses to do with, you know, with how we perceive temporality and how we can think about sound and different temporal levels. So it's like, you know, there is this back and forth between the kind of practise and the theory. You know, is there is a lot of kind of theory, which I kind of discovered through playing with the programme, and I kind of like trying to understand what's happening there, kind of point at me to like to act, to investigate. 
10.631349563598633;30.465730667114258;3;You know. What are these like? How can I conceptualise these small segments of sound? You know, how do they have some, like, you know, historical place and the way sound has been represented and approached and so on. So there is there is this is I mentioned this feedback process between between like, you know, the, the, the human user of the programme and, and the machine. Okay. Of that. Any other questions? Just.  The question is like maybe a question come through. I'm going to just think out loud as more of like a comment that is. Thank you very much. I, I don't work like my, my, my practise not to do is sound and composition, but I work with sound. And when you say that we work with a platform, we can give you a lot of like different routes to approach different theory. And like you talk about object oriented being programming, but then I guess you if you touch upon that in your research with an object or ontology and amoeba think you are kind of mirroring of imaginary and the real I mean, kind of maybe one of the question I say is like, what is your research question? As I'm I'm writing, I mean, in real writing, what is the research question you have for your own? 
9.635489463806152;29.54532241821289;3;I would have to I would have to open my thesis. And I want. That another artist by doing that, you know, seven thinking the spectrum of biology and that is yeah about spectrum morphology and of like kind of the ability to capture sound in body and the cause of sound and the yes. Yes. Like that and like find the kind of cultural relationship. And they also talk about the the limit of this, the constraints it gave you. I wonder, what can you work like? What is an alternative way to work with the constraints that you talk about of like the masking and masking? Is there a way to work with like you make the when you write a programming, can you possibly as a human perceive the sound without the programme, give you the the the graph without giving you the object like would they work from one way and then drive you somewhere else? I can't work with one side. 
11.277381896972656;32.44053268432617;3;Yeah, that's. That's interesting. Question. I mean, like like I'm like I'm often like unable to like to separate the, the, you know, the, the the visual from the sonic and or the formal and the sonic, they kind of go hand-in-hand. I often, you know, like often I'm often concerned with, like with some formal procedures. Uh. And just accept whatever the sonic result is as a as as just, you know, that's what it sounds like. I don't I try not to judge it as a you know, it's something I'm probably you've already heard it tonight that some of these sounds are not that pleasant. So like you mentioned, this spectral morphology that they mean like, like in this kind of strict sense of, like Dennis Smalley. Uh. 
10.196234703063965;35.082679748535156;3;Spectral morphology. So I haven't really like, used much of his.  Writing.  And my thesis. I kind of criticised some of the approaches like he, like maybe not not himself formalised, but some of the kind of conservative followers of his, of his way of, of approaching sound composition. And it's in this way of disregarding the. Uh. The causal listening, you know, because like the kind of. Uh. Spectral spectral morphology, like taken to this kind of extreme, disregards to the source of the sound that's only concerned with the, with the sound itself as a sound object. And, you know, this is this kind of radical interpretation of, of of of what Pierre Shafir was offering, that, you know, this axiomatic listening that you only listen to the sound for itself without thinking what is the the the kind of sound generating principle. So, like, you know, with me engaging so much with the with the, with the, you know, with the generative principles of, of, of the of the sound synthesis, the method and also like, you know, like, you know, like treating the computer programme as an artefact, you know, as this kind of like object of, of cultural significance. I'm kind of like, you know, kind of positioning myself against this view of, of, uh, listening for sound. 
8.613268852233887;34.549434661865234;3;Like sound. As, as a sound, you.  Know. And that is also quite interesting critique. Not so much of, of, of Danny's than his Smalley's. Uh. Spectral morphology, but the kind of original, original.  Uh. Kind of conceptualisation by Pierre Schaeffer by Farnsworth Bone. And he has published his book Sonic Army Archipelago. And I have a PDF like if you, if you don't have like a hard copy, I can send you a PDF. But he has proposed quite, quite interesting critique of, of Pierre Schaeffer.  Where he. Left basically to summarise it, it's quite it's like it goes on for like hundreds of pages. So just to summarise it quickly.  He.  He argues that it's impossible to listen for the sound. A sound?  Because. That, you know, something being a sound is already like it's already a something else, you know? And also and also there is he also points out this fact that, you know, the way we listen. It's not only there is the kind of filtering filtering aspect of it happening at several levels, that is this physiological way. You know, our, our auditory apparatus functions that are like cultural. 
9.487194061279297;36.331298828125;3;Uh. Kind of like, you know, perspectives which, which like, you know, makes us listen differently and so on. And he makes this argument that, you know, like, you know, like the, the listening for the sound sound is impossible. And, you know, the, you know, the, the the axiomatic listening by claiming that it's only concerned with the words with the sound, but it's not concerned with the source of the sound. It can be right about that. But it doesn't it doesn't account for, you know, other layers of, of, of, of what is involved in our listening, which are like, you know, like. You know.  Simple things, like where do we come from, you know, and what is our. 
8.652155876159668;35.745994567871094;3; You know, you know.  People listen differently. And, you know, there is there are this this this aspect of of of that of that which are like, you know, kind of disregarded by. By by this.  Kind of radical interpretations of of of of what Pierre Schaeffer has proposed. And and then is then is smiling, saying this. I loved any smallest analysis of sound, you know, like it's really a highly advanced engagement with, you know what? What sound can be of this like really analytic, analytic level. So thanks for bringing it up.  If things happen that interest. 
10.498531341552734;27.753841400146484;3;Feels like he's thinking of his special apology. Like decoding how we think of sound like you hear the doorbell ring. What? Like what I say and commentator. Yeah, yeah. What about? How can you think about it? About the sound and not thinking that it's a doorbell.  You know? Could I ask a question that's really related to this? What you just said from this perspective, thinking about snow as already being something else than sound. What do you mean when you say that sound can be a pure mathematical calculation? Well, no. 
-19.298908233642578;13.389280319213867;3;I don't mean that it can be. But, you know, and the. Because you use it, you don't use samples in this. No, I don't.  I don't. But. And the sound is mathematical equations. 
11.755346298217773;28.5683536529541;3; Well, I mean, not not not. That sound is an equation, but, you know, it can be represented as an. Equation.  And, you know, what I'm trying to point out is the the multiple ways of representing sound, you know, and. What is this sound or it sounds coming from the the pulsar, the poster.  Well. So like so the well. Like what? Well, like, what is what is the sound like? What you hear at the end is.  Like it's in the in, in your programme. 
10.1215181350708;33.594871520996094;3;I mean, so the sound happens at the very end of the whole formal process. Hmm. How is how. So it's generated by the mathematical equations. ] Well, yeah. Yeah. So, like, in the, in the kind of in the simplest way you could say that.  Yeah, that it's, it's, it's, it's, it's. Generated through Formulas.  And It's very complex to imagine. Then I also look at what like I wouldn't I wouldn't like I don't want to Like, you know, presented as this kind of like formalist, like, like totally formalist kind of world view of of of of of sound. Because, you know. What computers allows us to do is to kind of like think about this object us, you know, in this kind of multiple, you know, and there are multiple manifestations, you know, and and only because I'm interested in a kind of formalisation of of like objects and, and processes I engage with, you know, with. 
8.239372253417969;36.86129379272461;3;The. With with, you know, with. You know, with mathematical formulas, which are kind of like you could think about them as definitions of these objects and processes, but also, you know, that are already present within the programme, you know, other ways of, of, of looking at these objects, you know, there is this visual thing, you know, like they they they they are visible as functions. And you, you know, I often don't think about the the formal procedure behind them. I, you know, I think about them as shapes, which I'm combining and, you know. And and then kind of like putting together to like to generate generate sound out of it. So, you know, kind of thinking about it as. 
2.9884212017059326;33.349525451660156;3;As Formal. Thing is just one one side of the of the of the of the lack of of of the perspective I'm I'm working with especially. Even like when you like when you. That was one of my observations when I looked at kind of historical documents to do with not only with this particular sound synthesis method, but also other, other, other kind of like earlier synthesis, sound synthesis methods that they are often that are often kind. Of two. Simultaneous. Ways. Of defining what is the sound synthesis model. One is this formal. Kind of.  Like. 
7.153711318969727;27.753231048583984;3; Approach, like using not so much mathematics, but using formal language like and you've seen it. And. One of my on one of my diagrams they had this like, you know, like formal representation where I said like P plus X equals and so on. So it's not, it's not, it's not essentially like mathematics, but it's just like a formal.  Formal. 
-5.8892083168029785;25.850860595703125;3;Approach. And then the second one is this diagrammatic representation where you have the diagram of the, of the synthesis circuit. You've seen also some diagrams. And on my slides that are other diagrams kind of more technical, like, which are used in engineering where you represent objects. Uh. In a particular way and the relationship with with between them and that particular way. So there are always this two ways of. 
9.476621627807617;29.766067504882812;3;Of kind of representing and defining the the the generative principles, you know. So, you know, it is formal, but it's also like a visual and they are grammar diagrammatic.  If I ask another question. Sure. It will get you very dark and are scary. I'm thinking of. So kind of wonder. What do you think with like artists who used to work with sound and like would you think that is like not oppositional but that like a parallel power line to watch how you work with sound that you would have more control over it? Or is it not that same countries, better or worse, but then it just they have more of your. As a composer, you have more of an input into the sound you're making compared to try. And have a look like I haven't used the. 
-27.049102783203125;17.74582290649414;3;AI in this, like in this particular project.  But last year I. Worked on a commission for. A, for a.  Festival in Berlin. Where. I developed a synthetic voice. Which was which was. You know. Developed through this wavelength approach, which is a kind of type of artificial intelligence where you collect data, which in that case was audio recordings of, of. 
11.045620918273926;16.780847549438477;3;Of, of. Spoken.  Words. And then you feed that material into the system which analyses, analyses it and builds a digital model of, of, of the voice, which then you can. Use to.  For this text to text to speech systems.  So.  So then the model like a model allows you to, you know, to write things and the voice will speak it.  So the way. ] I used it is that like I asked a friend of mine, an actress. To. To imitate a voice of. A. Very. One of the. Earliest speech synthesis models from from the seventies, which sounds very robotic and very kind of artificial and kind of computerised. So so there was this. Kind of playfulness and interaction between humans trying to imitate the machine. So we recorded that material with her. Then we use that material for the for the analysis done by the artificial intelligence to construct a new voice. So then the new voice. Had to kind of like the the sounded like her voice but with this kind of like robotic like almost like flat, no accent articulation. And then I use that, that new rendering, the new voice as the as the sound source or the source. 
9.574121475219727;31.79445457458496;3;For the composition. And the composition kind of like involve like there was a libretto like a text which was read by this, by this new synthetic voice. And then there were like, you know, sounds happening.  Of. Specialised over hundred 28 loudspeakers. Like, one thing I've been like working a lot with over other many years is also like sound and space and, and, and working with different methods to like to, to, to distribute sound in space and move it in space. And so on. 
2.0551888942718506;35.39707946777344;3;So the composition, actually the one with synthetic voice was, was. Kind of conceptually kind of based around pulsars as far as this kind of synthetic objects, which are, on one hand, these. Astrophysical phenomena. On the other hand, they are, you know, kind of, you know, encapsulated through this sound synthesis model, but also they function as this discursive object of kind of like narrative and so on. So the whole composition was kind. Of. 
5.697385311126709;32.836708068847656;3;Trying to like play with this, this, this synthetic aspect of pulsars as this kind of multiple kind of integrative objects kind of functioning between different domains and kind of each domain is kind of, you know, like. So then you could think about pulsars like.  Like, like. 
-4.854687213897705;24.238021850585938;3;Not having kind of one, one space of functioning, but like functioning between, between and within multiple domains and like to grasp it, you kind of move and navigate between. 
7.530910968780518;31.122079849243164;3;These.  Different realms and you can see it from different perspectives and so on. So that's why I had this like voice thing, like speaking the basically telling a story of, you know, of or like telling people what is pulsar in the, you know, astrophysical domain or what is the what the pulsar and the and the sound synthesis domain also kind of like, you know, being a bit. 
8.959712982177734;32.71012496948242;3;More kind Of abstract, conceptual quoting kind of one the one philosopher.  I.  I really like to read on Francois Schmidt. She's a French, French philosopher and also like she writes quite a lot about epidemiology. And so like the libretto involved like some quotations from, from her texts about this objects which are. Kind of. Integrative, not they, they like, you know, they, they function within multiple realms and so on. And then the space also played this role of, of like, you know, kind of like allowing people to move around. It was the the the it was like presented as a sound installation where people could. 
16.651039123535156;-4.474706172943115;3;Move. Around and. And yet. Spend like 40 minutes, you know, and had their ears cleansed. And a lot of ideas come in just thinking. I think if I can find more information, better work.  Yeah, yeah, I will. I can post it here. Thank you. So yeah, the piece was called Synthetic Pulsar. Just need to find the time. Got it here. Thanks. I just need to see what I call the website. It just takes me to different websites from. Okay. So there were like there were two versions of the work. One was presented and as an installation, other one was presented as a. Kind of virtual. Virtual. Could have.  An environment. Where. You could access through the. Website. So that was the log down version. And then when the when we were finally able to like to do it in real time, like an, in like real life version, we did it and as an installation. Amazing. Thank you. Thank you very much. You're welcome.  Is it possible. At all to somehow experience the virtual version? Yeah.  I'm not sure. Let's. Let's see if that I don't think website. Is still working. Hmm. No, the website doesn't work. But I could possibly, like, put the web version and send a link. But, no, not. Not today. Because it. Yeah, so it was it was written in the. 
0.5161288380622864;28.395448684692383;3;Unity. Programming kind of environment. And yeah, I did, I did all the programming on both sides, too. Which. Was a new thing for me because I haven't done the kind of visual programming on that level before. But then then was like several problems with, with, with that because, you know, for that to be converted to work on the on the Web was kind of, you know, quite, quite a difficult process, especially to kind of reformat things.  And to do. 
24.01634979248047;7.183619976043701;3;It with it's kind of sound and so on. But you can have a look if it's if it's. If I can.  Put it on on the website and send the link and. And for the for the project with A.I. and working with voice. You said you worked with an actress as well, but was it was the project also about creating a new kind of custom made synthetic voice? Yes. Yes.  I'm asking because we find out we also had an idea for the new platform that we'll be working on for it to also have its own voice. But we we are not sure how doable it is. It's the Green Zone. Well, I have to say, like, I didn't do all of that on my own. I worked with. With a group of experts from a. Company called Two Thirds on Mars. They are based in Berlin. And it's a it's a quite, quite complex process. I must say, you know, to like to construct the voice from, like from scratch. Yeah. It's it's not it's. What was what was the project code?  Well, so like the project was called, like it's for this synthetic pulsar piece.  Part of it. Yeah, it was part of it. Yeah.  But just in spatial.  Yeah. Yeah.  But then I used like I worked with the same group of people on several other projects, including, like one installation I've worked on last year. 
24.088516235351562;6.991620063781738;3;Where we Recorded my voice and my friend's voice and then like the people from Birds of Mars, the researchers from there combined these two voices and created a model which is kind. Of. Yeah, kind of like mixture of our two voices. And then we used that voice to, to read the text for the exhibition. So yeah, it's it's, you know, it's it's it's not an easy task. Yeah. Fascinating.  Mm. Okay. I think maybe we should wrap up. Yeah. People, it's really been so long.  But I think, Martin, we will definitely be messaging you.  Yeah, please. Please do. Yeah. I'm looking forward to like to see how the project develops and if I'm like, if you are in Berlin.  Like, just, you know, get in touch.  If I'm in London, like, I will.  Keep. 
16.60418701171875;-4.954047679901123;3;You posted. If I'm going to come and do some.  Music playing in London. And I will also let you know. Yes. And you said you could share the link to the programme.  Yeah. But you know that that that this is more, more complicated because the I can, I can schedule what I can do, I can share a link with the. I think maybe, just maybe, you know, like maybe let's combine all the information in the email. So once you have a chance and you have a moment, you can.  Yeah. So the PDF and like all the other things you mentioned and if possible, if you. Find a way to somehow show us.  A bit of the joke, that would be amazing as well. So I think like altogether.  Superior, I'll, I'll do it over the weekend but I need to rest the rest of the world because I've been on the move.  For for too long.  Yeah. Um, so I. I guess. I guess we would leave you for your evening quick home. Thank you so much. Thanks a lot. It was. It was. Lovely to. Meet. Inspiring, really.  Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I look forward to like to see your work.

-38.747344970703125;0.4303798973560333;4;Think of your pelvis as your movement's brain. Let's the weight of the pelvis guide your movement rather than your rational brain. The pelvis is your brain. So we begin to open our bodies to the possibility of gentle movement. We allow ourselves to follow a pleasure or a desire to move as we start to give ourselves a full body massage against the floor. Or perhaps our own body parts might rub across each other. You might move your hand to your rib cage and feel your ribs and the rise and fall of breath. You might move your hands to your pelvic bones and feel them. When your bones are in your body, they are not bleached white like coral, but full of marrow. That gives them a pinky hue.
-39.88042449951172;0.8377992510795593;4;Our bones are 25% water, the marrow flowing through your bones like a river that continually nourishing the of the bone as they open out to branches of bone. Let your organs be soft and squishy. Soft heart. Soft lungs, soft intestine. We might roll a weight to one side or the other in a gentle rocking motion. The weight of the organs shift like sand in a bag. The heavy mass stays at the bottom. As we move, we let the organs massage around that weight. You might gently rocking your body side to side sense. And just observing how that gentle change in weight massages your organs. Keep breathing.
-39.58797836303711;0.047432661056518555;4;Let each breath floods over your soft body. Full neck full of pools of B listenening, water, full ofs, and living coral. With each breath, let your boat dissolve. Imagine you have however small that might be. Allow yourself to just follow it as the body gently awakens to the possibility of movement. Allow your body to just follow it. Perhaps it might fold or unfold. Your knees might bend up to your chest. You might flop to one side. You might want stretch or curl up or rock, or allow yourself to spill, spread out. Since your weight as liquid mass, lets soft sandy ground, melt the of your however small. Enjoy its sensation. Your pel and spell. Follow the breath. Keep following your pelvis spray as we try and find a way up out towards standing. So you might shift your weight onto, onto your side or your belly. Would you be awaken?
-29.21174430847168;-9.158469200134277;4;Keep moving that energy around your body, that sacred energy that's yours. And for your Ben pleasure, keep the pulls inside your body, moving around, soothing your bone that you stretching. She. Or shape as we slowly find our way to standing. The than I was. Take a gentle walk just around the, take some water or have a right. Do we just check any. Do you wanna, It's a bit louder. Yes. Thank you. Cool. Um, so what I thought we could do is some fo I won't say vocal, which we've, we've all used our entire lives to improvise together and, and play improv games. And I thought it would be fun because you are like non-musician. So it's, I we can play with it without kind of being, you know, people taking a person there. When you're an artist you tend to find where you identify, sense self, what you so do.
-4.406609535217285;-25.927576065063477;4;So yeah, set everyone up full ritual. If everybody makes full in everybody, then flow so we can start. Um, Weird, something very simple. So we'll just do, um, we'll call it a drone choir. So essentially what it is is everybody just singing one note and we don't have to worry about sort of, I'll say, so we'll discard the idea of like any sort of conscious thought related to either specifically like pitch or rhythm. Cause these are the things I, you know, obstruct us from like can sing before I can't do time. So it's not, it's not music. So we're focused mainly just on Tom Sombra is like aesthetic essentially. So like kind a respect, quality center. What sounds I using during that part? I'm thinking about it in terms of Tom or rhythm. So begin close eyes. 
-6.379376411437988;-21.08452796936035;4;Try just static to be with and all do is whenever you're ready, Take a deep breath and for the duration of that on the exhale, any note it can be as and maybe. Kind prompts is don't listen to yourself. Just try to everyone. So your involvement within the. And so you can see even just in that there was a kind of inherent contention curve within well just was a result of nobody. There was, nobody stood. It just results this kinda natural and yeah. Yeah. So you have these kinda Yeah. Kinda subconscious, kinda organizational. Consciously project. So I was thinking maybe we could try the same thing. Maybe we could do it a little bit shorter, but also moving around. So as we were, we all staff, we were closer ourselves, so So our experience
8.438593864440918;-33.27365493774414;4;Eyes cushioning. Yeah. Eyes or maybe, yeah, just short, just to see how it differs from the previous. Yeah. There's like a collective pulled specific directions. Yeah. Yeah. Use physical proximity as, and you uncomfortable with this, some accident. So, um, Um, Um, um, Um, yeah, So you can see that experience and I like to, Yeah, I really take basically this, I. Would, Um, so, um, it's very simple, uh, group game. Like I was talking about before, um, it's kind of stripping everything back. So not thinking about rhythm or melody. Um, and we're going to use like simple pH as the building blocks for this. So like phoning is just within language, like the smallest part that is in itself, uh, Um, and then there's another set key card, which is, um, expressions or kind emotional prompts to attach to the food. So this is, these phons are essentially are like bare minimum mum building blocks of, um, some sort of source material that we'll use in order to make the music and sound. Um, so I guess the parallel would be, I've chosen to do this because everybody has the same sort of control over creating small signs like.
6.1906962394714355;-32.51171875;4;Completely unconsciously. Like you don't have to think about the might shape you are or who. And so in the same way that and provides a musician practices to the point where they're not consciously aware of themselves producing the specific sound. Um, so you have access to all of this constant to think about this. And then, um, there might be some initial conscious thought involved in kinda projecting and expression or some form of emotion on it, but hopefully very quickly will become, um, your conscious mind will be listening to others, um, around you all yourselves. The.
6.805352687835693;-31.663677215576172;4;Okay. Um, so essentially to begin with, what we'll do, um, again, to remove the kind anxiety of, you know, so somebody conducting and a group of people as performers. So there's already a kind of hierarchy if you wanna put like that, I suppose. Um, or a hierarchy within the kind of rules of the improv game that were setting. And so this is also way that, um, I suppose I thought that you could maybe apply to your own meetings, um, in thinking of composition or, um, yeah, thinking of composition as creating context for something. And if you thinking a lot about different systems or design to work, this can be an interesting way of exploring different, um, and there's also, you could relate it to like the rules of computer, essentially your setting the list of parameters.
-1.5210700035095215;-26.88272476196289;4;It's kind way you, that way thinking to make music and you don't have to have. Musical training, whatever, in order to engage with. Um, so I think to begin with, maybe if we all act as one group again, like we did the last exercise, Um, so would you like to, So the conductor, I'll, I'll do an example and then we can ake turns in conducting each other. And so essentially all we need to is choose one and pair with motion jack and start with. So maybe if we could all do that together, it's less daunting to build, do together. Mm-hmm. . So extend it again. And so then, so to begin with, we'll start to introduce more maybe hand signals and not just be, uh, just the online, just be so we'll introduce hand signals into, just so was not very familiar. Yeah. So hand gestures very simple, begin with point is to one from people, so to. Um. That's, if you do, you can just do that in, somebody does that endless.
10.297365188598633;-23.71487808227539;4;So you see how it works and you see how it's very simple and the rules are very flexible. Um, and then without actually saying anything during, I was able just to gesture. Towards smaller groups and create this like larger set of rules that it's unspoken, you know, communicate that. Um, so let's, we'll start with one from and then . So yeah. So um, yeah, so you can so sound, so like volume, you can go this, so you could gesture towards different kind of textures and stuff like that. Was doing these kinda like bitch texture or you like a or Um, yeah, I mean see what you can get with So go. So I was using that in, but yeah, maybe it's interesting to, if we start with those and then you can add as you which to see what works. Yes. Uh, okay. Cool. So today, So are the groups project. Okay. Okay. And if you want, so also to the camera sometimes if you wanna come close and we're gonna take set. Well, I mean, I see, so you, we do kinda more your dynamic this or not.
10.189228057861328;-15.913723945617676;4;So I mean, would you like to work each other? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Shit. Yeah. Yeah. I guess just like, it's such a simple, small thing and it gives you so much scope for what, I mean, would you agree that that sounds like music? Like the, And so just in the relationships between science, you find that's, I mean, even in one texture, the, Yeah. The way everybody sits kinda nested with each other. Yeah. So yeah, I think it's a really simple way to make quite complicated means with a group of strangers. I mean, we've never done so. Yeah. Um, and what did that was good Was comments for your, Do you feel liberated as a result of this? Yes. Are you less afraid of making a fool of yourself in front of people that you respect? Which I, we all respect each other and Yeah, that was kind half the point. The other half the point is just have fun music and be creative.
8.09463882446289;-15.835636138916016;4;Wanna have a show? We can have a maybe. Okay. Like do something. Do you want some We don't have like I'm I think that's thinking maybe we can drink or something. That's, And she's vaccin. Well, is the table watching films on central? When you, Yeah. Yeah. And is in the hospital. I, she's fine, she's fine, but she finally, she got another virus, but she said it's, it's, she been sick. Yes. She had became dehydrate. She wasn't out. And then, um, she had to go back because she was little relationship with her, something. Um, did she have No, no, she was in hospital, but then she, but I mean, I haven't to, I mean, she said she's fine from.
-24.317707061767578;-17.178865432739258;4;Um, so we're gonna do some, we're gonna dosome partner work. Um, But if you're joining online, you can apply this to yourself and do self, self touch. Um, so hopefully it will work for you online if you are on your own and in remotely. Okay? So if you like, we, we got enough. So two, someone in the Yes. Yeah. Partner with them. Join for you. What we're gonna is if one person wants to lie and the other person can sit sort of at their shoulder, like a little, a little gremlin, , no. And we're just waiting for the other person to join before just check in, partner and, and check Kay with being touched. Maybe they have, um, I dunno if anyone's got injuries asked. So if you'd like to lie down. Um, okay, so we've got, we're gonna swap, we've got two. We've got a toucher and a person who's receive the touch. So the person who is the touch's something. So no, is, that's pretty.
-25.424816131591797;-15.676923751831055;4;If you're tuning in, you can, you can do this to yourself. So the person who's touching, if you want to rub your hands together and make sure they're nice and warm and activated. And what we're gonna is we're very gently put our hands on the person's body and apply gentle pressure. So you can put your hands or hands wherever. Maybe you wanna start the feet or in their hands or on their, um, heads. And you can, you can hold your hands above or you can make contact with the hand and it's just a healing touch and you're just making them aware of that part of their body. And once you've done that for a bit, you can change to a different body part so you to a hit phone.
-25.658708572387695;-14.394023895263672;4;And you can either hold your hands above a body part, or you can actually make contact with the body part. And keep moving around their body and the person who's lying there, you might start to become aware of a place that they're touching. You might be a leg or foot and you might follow the touch you, their energy hovering above. So the next time you receive touch or you feel heat, maybe some hands hovering above you just very gently move. So might be luing, the heads from side to side or lifting a hand or a shoulder or a foot, a scanning and pulling around your body wraps. From head to toe, from front to back in closing and separating from what is me and what is not me. Moment by moment protecting the deeper, softer tissues of the body, keeping out what's may harm, um, warming us through pain and pain and quick repair. All living things have a skin.
-26.41952133178711;-15.372289657592773;4;Boundary between internal and external a membrane so the person lying on the floor, try and follow the next touch you receive. Move into the touch and then your partner's hands will move to somewhere on your body and let initiate the next movement. You think of a your guides you and helps initiate where the next comes from. Just think of this as a massage, just moving for your own pleasure. Toucher, keep moving your touch around the body and giving them guided guidance and the person's touching. You can just step away and give them a moment to move on. Then you refresh bodies swapping over, changing roles. When you ready a hand, rest the hand gently on. Or you can hold it hovering slightly above. Notice their bodily presence under your skin, your hand impulse to your partner. Trust in knowing where to go.
-25.984041213989258;-16.4070987701416;4;And from the of the skin, over half a million sensory fibers, fiber, fiber, the cord. Intricate. The skin is the outer surface of the brain and the brain turn rests in the lining of the skin. Start to initiate. The hand calls you to move. Follow the touch. Next time you touch from your partner, really your body, you the person touching must act as a guide to make sure the person is safe, the person being touched. Enjoy this freedom. Actually find a dialogue still slowly find way to position and enjoy this pathway. Journey up away. Gradually find our standing position as the movements. Those hands inside our bodies, a resting space. We all find a comfortable standing place. Okay. The. Rains. Um, it's basically like an external nervous system instrument. See? So I'm gonna have, um, three at the moment. We've got three strains on each, between each one. And, um, this is like a belt and it all the tubes go up to different points on my body. And they have like sensors, stretch sensors and muscle sensors and stuff. So as I make a movement, um, feeds back to Craig through this, like that's all his tech.
2.9083309173583984;-34.874061584472656;4;Um, and so there's heart rate monitor. It's these three bats here. And so that'll be on chest. And then there, this is attached to muscle be on the leg. This one goes to a muscle tension sensor, an arm here and there's one, these are for another muscle, muscle tension sensor. They'll be on the face. Um, and then the one that go to the arms and legs here will be joined by these stretching. So this is just like, um, like a sensor essentially are just through it, and as it stretches the resistance of the rubber chord changes and therefore you can monitor on the other end a change in value. So we translating, um, yeah, just the, So when I, when I'm reading around, it's making sound. Well, yeah. So change, and so within this, it's not actually, um, controlling any audio per se. It's just all this information is translate, it goes through this box here.
5.193148612976074;-35.06510543823242;4;And, and then each of these values I can translate through midi, which is like a standard music, uh, computer music language, um, can translate to sound in various different ways. We're only kind of really starting to experiment with it as an instrument. We've just finished kind of putting it together and getting it to work properly. Seven, there's a little bit of tech in there. It's. And some of the, um, boards for the specific sensors, so for the heart rate monitor and all the muscles. Um, so yeah, by the time it gets to computer and whatever instrument attach to, we should be able to control various, like any parameter music making process, um, in real time.So the idea I suppose, wasn't so much to replace because we work a lot as to we all performing and moving and, um, creating the sound. Um, so it wasn't so much to replace my responsibility or my conscious, um, position. My own ideas were onto Holly's movement. It's more of just having another layer of, um, parameters that are in like direct link to do more these movements and before I can then, you know, focus on like larger kinda, I'm just making, making more codependent.
2.4315195083618164;-29.5291805267334;4;So the, so the was to have, we were gonna do. Um, so from toe to finger each hand. So we've got this axis movement that's tracked and then we're experimenting with somehow having more streams that were coming into the body. Um, so we on the head and on the neck, some sort collar, Yeah. Just to kind as a way of tracking movement access, I guess, as well as this access. But yeah, we're still figuring out prototype, but yeah. But yeah. And parameter like frequency. Yeah. So, so yeah, you could assign it. I mean, it's like insanely flexible, I suppose. Um, so yeah, you could say attach it to like a single oscillator, so it's controlling the frequency of an oscillator. Or you could pre-program, um, Or have recorded audio that you're playing and then have effects or, um, different processes attached to that audio or that sound source.
1.912443995475769;-22.76071548461914;4;And it could be controlling different parameters of that. And I think it'll really, I think to begin with it's quite overwhelming having so much information, so much data constantly. And it would be a case of kinda like, um, yeah, setting out maybe like a larger palette of things that can be controlled by different parts of it. And the actual improvisational process in the moment will be just pulling things in and out and signing different or opening gates to allow certain ture to be controlled by different parts. But also as well, like we could have made it wireless, but we really liked this well of wires. Like the of mm. Yeah. Changed the way you move as well. Having physical connection I think. Yeah. So, yeah. So when you guys gonna try, When can we hear residency? We're in late. Before. Before, I think. But I'm finding for some reason this latex was perishing like color. Well I made it, it was like pale. It's already gone. Really dark. It might be, Yeah. It blue or I that it oxidizes with doesn't, I think it general, like, I think somehow you have to make it stop from changing the color.
10.324776649475098;-26.720869064331055;4;Because I remember my models and stuff that were just made like changing color to that. Yeah. On their own. And did that happen really quickly? Other, Wait, sorry. Have you, have you tried? Um, cuz, cuz late latex is always gonna turn that weird yellowy color. Yeah. But, um, silicones and Hanes, uh, are usually like more stable. Okay, Okay. In terms of coloring. So you can get clear silicon, um, that you, you can get stuff that basically has the exact same feel as flesh if you want that kind of tactility Yeah. Size as well. Yeah, you just, you wanna look, you wanna ask them for like a soft Sure. Hardness. Okay. Um, but they're specifically, it, it, it's a bit more expensive in, in England, but there's some stuff called, Yeah. But there's some stuff by a company called Smooth on, called Dragon Skin. Oh. And that it's, if you want like a tactile, squishy feel plus you can dye it.
12.099163055419922;-26.440872192382812;4;Amazing. Yeah. If, if you want, uh, just shoot me, shoot me an email if you want help. That's, I mean, just in general, rubber resin, mold banking, plastic shit, if anyone has you. Awesome. Thank you so much. Drag ski. Um, yeah, that's, um, yeah, hopefully work one day. We'll see. And how, decide what sound coming, the um, well we haven't, I suppose we've kind of got like an established. Of the types of s we already used that probably Cause I mean a lot of this stuff that I was using now is kind of a combination of like all collective we've done, um, recording. Yeah. I think I recognize and it's quite strange all at once associate, but yeah, a lot of field recordings and like then sort of distort them. Yeah. But also I've got a lot, I build a lot of instruments which are like, um, computer controlled, but acoustic sources. So like, uh, so, or various different like percussion things with like hammers on them or some like, um, feedback kind of machines or like collection speakers, microphones that rotate, like speakers and stuff.
30.632673263549805;-11.344189643859863;4;Like, So it's really flexible in terms of Yeah, it's just how we assign. The information gathered to an I do so, but I think with the residency it might be quite interesting to like if just serious performances with different science sources. Cause I think it would be quite, you know, it could be completely different pieces even with the same, Yeah. Other result would be completely different. Interesting thinking like creating sound of the body or creating sound in relation to the space. Yeah. Especially think like a sound like dun. Yeah. Invisible dun. But all this lines, Yeah, definitely. Cause one thing actually that we were ing was having a live head mic on as well. So that then it would be just a live feed from the room, not necessarily sitting. Oh, gonna do that. Yeah. Yeah, I've got that. Um, so live feed from the room. So then her movements are, you know, she's, as she's made, she's capturing different happening space and the actual based itself. And then all of the information is just used to like process that live feed, which I think might be quite interesting. Kinda nice. Kinda like rub between the reality. Exactly. Yeah. Interesting. Huh. So yeah, I think it's pretty flexible. Just what. And it feels like you could be able to it. And this maybe wrap, so it like straps to my joints. So the cheeks strap to my body, they're, no, so there's microphones, these are just like, um, dunno, you use, like if you go to the doctoring, your heart rate, it's really heart, heart rate. So I think it's just like a way of, I think on one end they put a really small voltage through and then just measure the change in voltage to Cause each one is like gang in threes like that.
0.06703732907772064;-34.868350982666016;4;So I'm assuming one of them is like, Very small pH, and this is reading the change in as muscle. So if. Silly video. Nobody's gonna judge me. , we're all friends here now. I've already made full. What does the sensor really sense? What does sense? Um, it sense a muscle tensing and relaxing heart rate. Monitor the heart rate. So this is increase or decrease. Um, so that's just attached to, So all that is, is really right. You're not supposed that. Yeah. If that helps you. Imagine what might not end up coming this interesting go wireless, but, but it's also really obsessed with old analog aesthetics and retro Yeah. That aesthetic. Also, the idea of like everything. You know, this has got more advanced technology than, than any of this here everybody's got. But like the physical, psychological weight of carrying that around, you know, buzz visually a bit more tethering. Yeah, visual options. Yeah, so just rubber conductive, rubber kids or stretch sensors you can buy likes, ands of it for online. Thank you so much. Everyone online as well. I hope that was somehow accessible. And what we'd like to now is if everybody stand and God save.
-35.770042419433594;1.5029220581054688;4;Yeah. Cool. That's She's not. Thank you. Thanks a lot. A starfish mouth is in its center. Our belly button was also our first mouth when we were in the wound. Think of your core as a place of nourishment. Breathe deeply into your belly. Lets the inhale of fresh breath fill your limbs with every exhale. Focus on releasing tension of blockages. You might feel a particular tension somewhere. Focus your energy on breathing deeply into this area. Keep your attention, light and playful. Your limbs are antenna sensory S that reach out gradually move your awareness around each of your six lens, starting at your right shoulder. Elbow through to your wrist and fingers to gently like leaves wrestling on. Now bring your attention to your and head. You might to lu side to the, and. Your left shoulder, elbow, wrist, left fingers. Now draw your attention to your left hip. Extend your energy out through the knee, ankle, toes. Now we bring our attention to our tail reaches down like a tree into the soil, reaching towards our animal, Instinct it, and keep scanning through your right hip, Write right ankle, right toes.
-38.46118927001953;0.4107331335544586;4;Observe your temperature. Are you hot or cold? Now let's drop through the of the body. Dropping the tissues, the muscles, the skin of the cavities, the marrow within the bone. Feel the length of the spine long the space between each vertebrae spreading out. Imagine you imprinting the body into imagine a big bowl of clear water ti water swishes, and cleanse around your pelvis. Pelvis. Think of your pelvis as your movement's brain. Let's the weight of the pelvis guide your movement rather than your rational brain. The pelvis is your brain. So we begin to open our bodies to the possibility of gentle movement. We allow ourselves to follow a pleasure or a desire to move as we start to give ourselves a full body massage against the floor. Or perhaps our own body parts might rub across each other. You might move your hand to your rib cage and feel your ribs and the rise and fall of breath.
-39.64832305908203;0.9791635870933533;4;You might move your hands to your pelvic bones and feel them. When your bones are in your body, they are not bleached white like coral, but full of marrow. That gives them a pinky hue. Our bones are 25% water, the marrow flowing through your bones like a river that continually nourishing the of the bone as they open out to branches of bone. Let your organs be soft and squishy. Soft heart. Soft lungs, soft intestine. We might roll a weight to one side or the other in a gentle rocking motion. The weight of the organs shift like sand in a bag. The heavy mass stays at the bottom. As we move, we let the organs massage around that weight.
-39.802947998046875;-0.05060360208153725;4;You might gently rocking your body side to side sense. And just observing how that gentle change in weight massages your organs. Keep breathing. Let each breath floods over your soft body. Full nec full of pools of B listenening, water, full ofs, and living coral. With each breath, let your boat dissolve. Imagine you have however small that might be. Allow yourself to just follow it as the body gently awakens to the possibility of movement. Allow your body to just follow it. Perhaps it might fold or unfold. Your knees might bend up to your chest. You might flop to one side. You might want stretch or curl up or rock, or allow yourself to spill, spread out. Since your weight as liquid mass, lets soft sandy ground, melt the of your however small. Enjoy its sensation. Your pel and spell. Follow the breath. Keep following your pelvis spray as we try and find a way up out towards standing. So you might shift your weight onto, onto your side or your belly. Would you be awaken?
-29.211271286010742;-9.158830642700195;4;Keep moving that energy around your body, that sacred energy that's yours. And for your Ben pleasure, keep the pulls inside your body, moving around, soothing your bonethat you stretching. She. Or shape as we slowly find our way to standing. The than I was. Take a gentle walk just around the, take some water or have a right. Do we just check any. Do you wanna, It's a bit louder. Yes. Thank you. Cool. Um, so what I thought we could do is some fo I won't say vocal, which we've, we've all used our entire lives to improvise together and, and play improv games. And I thought it would be fun because you are like non-musician. So it's, I we can play with it without [02:34:00] kind of being, you know, people taking a person there. When you're an artist you tend to find where you identify, sense self, what you so do.
-4.409041404724121;-25.926822662353516;4;So yeah, set everyone up full ritual. If everybody makes full in everybody, then flow so we can start. Um, Weird, something very simple. So we'll just do, um, we'll call it a drone choir. So essentially what it is is everybody just singing one note and we don't have to worry about sort of, I'll say, so we'll discard the idea of like any sort of conscious thought related to either specifically like pitch or rhythm. Cause these are the things I, you know, obstruct us from like can sing before I can't do time. So it's not, it's not music. So we're focused mainly just on Tom Sombra is like aesthetic essentially. So like kind a respect, quality center. What sounds I using during that part? I'm thinking about it in terms of Tom or rhythm.
-6.177592754364014;-21.222976684570312;4;So begin close eyes. Try just static to be with and all do is whenever you're ready, Take a deep breath and for the duration of that on the exhale, any note it can be as and maybe. Kind prompts is don't listen to yourself. Just try to everyone. So your involvement within the. And so you can see even just in that there was a kind of inherent contention curve within well just was a result of nobody. There was, nobody stood. It just results this kinda natural and yeah. Yeah. So you have these kinda Yeah. Kinda subconscious, kinda organizational. Consciously project. So I was thinking maybe we could try the same thing. Maybe we could do it a little bit shorter, but also moving around. So as we were, we all staff, we were closer ourselves, so So our experience Eyes cushioning. Yeah. Eyes or maybe, yeah, just short, just to see how it differs from the previous Yeah. There's like a collective pulled specific directions. Yeah. Yeah. Use physical proximity as, And you uncomfortable with this, some accident. So, um, Um, Um, um, Um, yeah, So you can see that experience and I like to, Yeah, I really take basically this, I.
8.142698287963867;-33.194156646728516;4;Would, Um, so, um, it's very simple, uh, group game. Like I was talking about before, um, it's kind of stripping everything back. So not thinking about rhythm or melody. Um, and we're going to use like simple pH as the building blocks for this. So like phoning is just within language, like the smallest part that is in itself, s, uh, Um, and then there's another set key card, which is, um, expressions or kind emotional prompts to attach to the food. So this is, these phons are essentially are like bare minimum mum building blocks of, um, some sort of source material that we'll use in order to make the music and sound. Um, so I guess the parallel would be, I've chosen to do this because everybody has the same sort of control over creating small signs like. Completely unconsciously. Like you don't have to think about the might shape you are or who. And so in the same way that and provides a musician practices to the point where they're not consciously aware of themselves producing the specific sound. Um, so you have access to all of this constant to think about this.
6.916764259338379;-32.044185638427734;4;And then, um, there might be some initial conscious thought involved in kinda projecting and expression or some form of emotion on it, but hopefully very quickly will become, um, your conscious mind will be listening to others, um, around you all yourselves. The. Okay. Um, so essentially to begin with, what we'll do, um, again, to remove the kind anxiety of, you know, so somebody conducting and a group of people as performers. So there's already a kind of hierarchy if you wanna put like that, I suppose. Um, or a hierarchy within the kind of rules of the improv game that were setting. And so this is also way that, um, I suppose I thought that you could maybe apply to your own meetings, um, in thinking of composition or, um, yeah, thinking of composition as creating context for something.
6.13662576675415;-31.26100730895996;4;And if you thinking a lot about different systems or design to work, this can be an interesting way of exploring different, um, and there's also, you could relate it to like the rules of computer, essentially your setting the list of parameters. It's kind way you, that way thinking to make music and you don't have to have. Musical training, whatever, in order to engage with. Um, so I think to begin with, maybe if we all act as one group again, like we did the last exercise, Um, so would you like to, So the conductor, I'll, I'll do an example and then we can take turns in conducting each other.
-1.554544448852539;-26.85918617248535;4;And so essentially all we need to is choose one and pair with motion jack and start with. So maybe if we could all do that together, it's less daunting to build, do together. Mm-hmm. . So extend it again. And so then, so to begin with, we'll start to introduce more maybe hand signals and not just be, uh, just the online, just be so we'll introduce hand signals into, just so was not very familiar. Yeah. So hand gestures very simple, begin with point is to one from people, so to. Um, That's, if you do, you can just do that in, somebody does that endless. So you see how it works and you see how it's very simple and the rules are very flexible. Um, and then without actually saying anything during, I was able just to gesture. Towards smaller groups and create this like larger set of rules that it's unspoken, you know, communicate that. Um, so let's, we'll start with one from and then . So yeah. 
10.305337905883789;-23.70271110534668;4;So um, yeah, so you can so sound, so like volume, you can go this, so you could gesture towards different kind of textures and stuff like that. Was doing these kinda like bitch texture or you like a or Um, yeah, I mean see what you can get with So go. So I was using that in, but yeah, maybe it's interesting to, if we start with those and then you can add as you which to see what works. Yes. Uh, okay. Cool. So today, So are the groups project. Okay. Okay. And if you want, so also to the camera sometimes if you wanna come close and we're gonna take set. Well, I mean, I see, so you, we do kinda more your dynamic this or not So I mean, would you like to work each other?
10.29578971862793;-15.983857154846191;4;Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Shit. Yeah. Yeah. I guess just like, it's such a simple, small thing and it gives you so much scope for what, I mean, would you agree that that sound like music? Like the, And so just in the relationships between science, you find that's, I mean, even in one texture, the, Yeah. The way everybody sits kinda nested with each other. Yeah. So yeah, I think it's a really simple way to make quite complicated means with a group of strangers. I mean, we've never done so Yeah. Um, and what did that was good Wasn comments for your, Do you feel liberated as a result of this? Yes. Are you less afraid of making a fool of yourself in front of people that you respect? Which I, we all respect each other and Yeah, that was kind half the point. The other half the point is just have fun music and be creative. Wanna have a show? We can have a maybe. Okay. Like do something. Do you want some We don't have like I'm I think that's thinking maybe we can drink or something. That's, And she's vaccin. Well, is the table watching films on central? When you, Yeah. Yeah. And is in the hospital. I, she's fine, she's fine, but she finally, she got another virus, but she said it's, it's, she been sick. Yes. She had became dehydrate. She wasn't out. And then, um, she had to go back because she was little relationship with her, something. Um, did she have No, no, she was in hospital, but then she, but I mean, I haven't to, I mean, she said she's fine from. Um, so we're gonna do some, we're gonna do some partner work. Um, But if you're joining online, you can apply this to yourself and do self, self touch. Um, so hopefully it will work for you online if you are on your own and in remotely. Okay? So if you like, we, we got enough. So two, someone in the Yes. Yeah. Partner with them.
-24.62358283996582;-16.80245018005371;4;Join for you. What we're gonna is if one person wants to lie and the other person can sit sort of at their shoulder, like a little, a little gremlin, , no. And we're just waiting for the other person to join before just check in, partner and, and check Kay with being touched. Maybe they have, um, I dunno if anyone's got injuries asked. So if you'd like to lie down. Um, okay, so we've got, we're gonna swap, we've got two. We've got a toucher and a person who's receive the touch. So the person who is the touch's something. So no, is, that's pretty, If you're tuning in, you can, you can do this to yourself. So the person who's touching, if you want to rub your hands together and make sure they're nice and warm and activated. And what we're gonna is we're very gently put our hands on the person's body and apply gentle pressure. So you can put your hands or hands wherever. Maybe you wanna start the feet or in their hands or on their, um, heads. And you can, you can hold your hands above or you can make contact with the hand and it's just a healing touch and you're just making them aware of that part of their body. 
-25.596134185791016;-14.38770866394043;4;And once you've done that for a bit, you can change to a different body part so you to a hit phone. And you can either hold your hands above a body part, or you can actually make contact with the body part. And keep moving around their body and the person who's lying there, you might start to become aware of a place that they're touching. You might be a leg or foot and you might follow the touch you, their energy hovering above.So the next  time you receive touch or you feel heat, maybe some hands hovering above you just very gently move. So might be luing, the heads from side to side or lifting a hand or a shoulder or a foot, a scanning and pulling around your body wraps contains. From head to toe, from front to back in closing and separating from what is me and what is not me. Moment by moment protecting the deeper, softer tissues of the body, keeping out what's may harm, um, warming us through pain and pain and quick repair.
-26.36082649230957;-15.680344581604004;4;All living things have a skin. Boundary between internal and external a membrane so the person lying on the floor, try and follow the next touch you receive. Move into the touch and then your partner's hands will move to somewhere on your body and let initiate the next movement. You think of a your guides you and helps initiate where the next comes from. Just think of this as a massage, just moving for your own pleasure. Toucher, keep moving your touch around the body and giving them guided guidance and the person's touching. You can just step away and give them a moment to move on. Then you refresh bodies swapping over, changing roles. When you ready a hand, rest the hand gently on. Or you can hold it hovering slightly above. Notice their bodily presence under your skin, your hand impulse to your partner. Trust in knowing where to go. And from the of the skin, over half a million sensory fibers, fiber, fiber, the cord. Intricate. The skin is the outer surface of the brain and the brain turn rests in the lining of the skin Start to initiate. The hand calls you to move. Follow the touch. Next time you touch from your partner, really your body, you the person touching must act as a guide to make sure the person is safe, the person being touched. Enjoy this freedom. Actually find a dialogue still slowly find way to position and enjoy this pathway. Journey up away. Gradually find our standing position as the movements. Those ands inside our bodies, a resting space. We all find a comfortable standing place. Okay. The. Rains. Um, it's basically like an external nervous system instrument. 
3.0447115898132324;-34.8789176940918;4;See? So I'm gonna have, um, three at the moment. We've got three strains on each, between each one. And, um, this is like a belt and it all the tubes go up to different points on my body. And they have like sensors, stretch sensors and muscle sensors and stuff. So as I make a movement, um, feeds back to Craig through this, like that's all his tech. Um, and so there's heart rate monitor. It's these three bats here. And so that'll be on chest. And then there, this is attached to muscle be on the leg. This one goes to a muscle tension sensor, an arm here and there's one, these are for another muscle, muscle tension sensor. They'll be on the face. Um, and then the one that go to the arms and legs here will be joined by these stretching. So this is just like, um, like a sensor essentially are just through it, and as it stretches the resistance of the rubber chord changes and therefore you can monitor on the other end a change in value. So we translating, um, yeah, just the, So when I, when I'm reading around, it's making sound. Well, yeah. So change, and so within this, it's not actually, um, controlling any audio per se.
5.172598361968994;-35.06790542602539;4;It's just all this information is translate, it goes through this box here. And, and then each of these values I can translate through midi, which is like a standard music, uh, computer music language, um, can translate to sound in various different ways. We're only kind of really starting to experiment with it as an instrument. We've just finished kind of putting it together and getting it to work properly. Seven, there's a little bit of tech in there. It's. And some of the, um, boards for the specific sensors, so for the heart rate monitor and all the muscles. Um, so yeah, by the time it gets to computer and whatever instrument attach to, we should be able to control various, like any parameter music making process, um, in real time. So the idea I suppose, wasn't so much to replace because we work a lot as to we all performing and moving and, um, creating the sound. Um, so it wasn't so much to replace my responsibility or my conscious, um, position. My own ideas were onto Holly's movement. It's more of just having another layer of, um, parameters that are in like direct link to do more these movements and before I can then, you know, focus on like larger kinda, I'm just making, making more codependent.
2.4315290451049805;-29.529190063476562;4;So the, so the was to have, we were gonna do. Um, so from toe to finger each hand. So we've got this axis movement that's tracked and then we're experimenting with somehow having more streams that were coming into the body. Um, so we on the head and on the neck, some sort collar, Yeah. Just to kind as a way of tracking movement access, I guess, as well as this access. But yeah, we're still figuring out prototype, but yeah. But yeah. And parameter like frequency. Yeah. So, so yeah, you could assign it. I mean, it's like insanely flexible, I suppose. Um, so yeah, you could say attach it to like a single oscillator, so it's controlling the frequency of an oscillator. Or you could pre-program, um, Or have recorded audio that you're playing and then have effects or, um, different processes attached to that audio or that sound source.
1.912443995475769;-22.76071548461914;4;And it could be controlling different parameters of that. And I think it'll really, I think to begin with it's quite overwhelming having so much information, so much data constantly. And it would be a case of kinda like, um, yeah, setting out maybe like a larger palette of things that can be controlled by different parts of it. And the actual improvisational process in the moment will be just pulling things in and out and signing different or opening gates to allow certain ture to be controlled by different parts. But also as well, like we could have made it wireless, but we really liked this well of wires. Like the of mm. Yeah. Changed the way you move as well. Having physical connection I think. Yeah. So, yeah. So when you guys gonna try, When can we hear residency? We're in late. Before. Before, I think. But I'm finding for some reason this latex was perishing like color. Well I made it, it was like pale. It's already gone. Really dark. It might be, Yeah. It blue or I that it oxidizes with doesn't, I think it general, like, I think somehow you have to make it stop from changing the color.
10.145033836364746;-26.779783248901367;4;Because I remember my models and stuff that were just made like changing color to that. Yeah. On their own. And did that happen really quickly? Other, Wait, sorry. Have you, have you tried? Um, cuz, cuz late latex is always gonna turn that weird yellowy color. Yeah. But, um, silicones and Hanes, uh, are usually like more stable. Okay, Okay. In terms of coloring. So you can get clear silicon, um, that you, you can get stuff that basically has the exact same feel as flesh if you want that kind of tactility Yeah.
11.738544464111328;-26.456256866455078;4;Size as well. Yeah, you just, you wanna look, you wanna ask them for like a soft Sure. Hardness. Okay. Um, but they're specifically, it, it, it's a bit more expensive in, in England, but there's some stuff called, Yeah. But there's some stuff by a company called Smooth on, called Dragon Skin. Oh. And that it's, if you want like a tactile, squishy feel plus you can dye it. Amazing. Yeah. If, if you want, uh, just shoot me, shoot me an email if you want help. That's, I mean, just in general, rubber resin, mold banking, plastic shit, if anyone has you. Awesome. Thank you so much. Drag ski. Um, yeah, that's, um, yeah, hopefully work one day. We'll see. And how, decide what sound coming, the um, well we haven't, I suppose we've kind of got like an established. Of the types of s we already used that probably Cause I mean a lot of this stuff that I was using now is kind of a combination of like all collective we've done, um, recording. Yeah. I think I recognize and it's quite strange all at once associate, but yeah, a lot of field recordings and like then sort of distort them.
30.47812843322754;-11.186220169067383;4;Yeah. But also I've got a lot, I build a lot of instruments which are like, um, computer controlled, but acoustic sources. So like, uh, so, or various different like percussion things with like hammers on them or some like, um, feedback kind of machines or like collection speakers, microphones that rotate, like speakers and stuff. Like, So it's really flexible in terms of Yeah, it's just how we assign. The information gathered to an I do so, but I think with the residency it might be quite interesting to like if just serious performances with different science sources. Cause I think it would be quite, you know, it could be completely different pieces even with the same, Yeah. Other result would be completely different. Interesting thinking like creating sound of the body or creating sound in relation to the space. Yeah. Especially think like a sound like dun. Yeah. Invisible dun. But all this lines, Yeah, definitely. Cause one thing actually that we were ing was having a live head mic on as well.
31.020788192749023;-11.909832954406738;4;So that then it would be just a live feed from the room, not necessarily sitting. Oh, gonna do that. Yeah. Yeah, I've got that. Um, so live feed from the room. So then her movements are, you know, she's, as she's made, she's capturing different happening space and the actual based itself. And then all of the information is just used to like process that live feed, which I think might be quite interesting. Kinda nice. Kinda like rub between the reality. Exactly. Yeah. Interesting. Huh. So yeah, I think it's pretty flexible. Just what. And it feels like you could be able to it. And this maybe wrap, so it like straps to my joints. So the cheeks strap to my body, they're, no, so there's microphones, these are just like, um, dunno, you use, like if you go to the doctoring, your heart rate, it's really heart, heart rate. So I think it's just like a way of, I think on one end they put a really small voltage through and then just measure the change in voltage to Cause each one is like gang in threes like that. So I'm assuming one of them is like, Very small pH, and this is reading the change in as muscle. So if. Silly video. Nobody's gonna judge me. , we're all friends here now. I've already made full. What does the sensor really sense? What does sense? Um, it sense a muscle tensing and relaxing heart rate. Monitor the heart rate. So this is increase or decrease. Um, so that's just attached to,
-0.05019506439566612;-34.8658447265625;4;So all that is, is really right. You're not supposed that. Yeah. If that helps you. Imagine what might not end up coming this interesting go wireless, but, but it's also really obsessed with old analog aesthetics and retro Yeah. That aesthetic. Also, the idea of like everything. You know, this has got more advanced technology than, than any of this here everybody's got. But like the physical, psychological weight of carrying that around, you know, buzz visually a bit more tethering. Yeah, visual options. Yeah, so just rubber conductive, rubber kids or stretch sensors you can buy likes, ands of it for online. Thank you so much. Everyone online as well. I hope that was somehow accessible. And what we'd like to now is if everybody stand and God save. Yeah. Cool. That's She's not. Thank you. Thanks a lot.
8.127070426940918;-15.31002426147461;6;To to get, to get it with a transcript. Yeah. That might be interesting to get a transcript. Uh, yeah. Does it work? Yeah. Okay. So shall we? Yeah, do it. Is there anything else, uh, that we want to say or we just go straight in? Think we can just go in? Maybe, Yes, someone can say something. I actually, I just thought, I dunno what, um, what is possible, but as far as I know, Miko said that whoever has speakers to be on speakers. Um, so just reminding like if you have speaker support speakers, but it's fine. It's fine if it's not on speakers Right. As well. It's fine. Like once we get to the point, the point of the listening, it may be okay if may be good to even try headphones and then your laptop speakers to see the difference because there will be, Any difference.
17.532386779785156;-36.159942626953125;6;Um, but we'll get to that in a second. So, um, well, let's start with a little introduction. I, we actually know each other with Nico for very long time, and we've worked together, uh, on several occasions including one major project that was very much concerned with voice and that was, uh, performance and OV that we did together. Um, and Miko is a sound artist, but I think he's gonna be better in, uh, telling you a little bit about his work. So I give it to here. Okay. Um, yeah. Hi. Um, I'm, I, yeah, I guess I'm sound artist and I do stuff to do with recordings, boys music and whatnot, and I'm not really gonna talk much about my work or anything.
19.604597091674805;-26.602426528930664;6;Um, I guess we have a few things to get to, um, that may be interesting. Um, and this is probably gonna be really, um, Experimental in nature because I don't really know what's gonna happen and how you're gonna react to whatever ha whatever's gonna happen. And even the transcription, um, device that we have on through Zoom will probably think something too that will be, um, unpredictable in a way. So, so we'll see what happens. But I'm basically, I have been for a while interested in these, these situations where, where artificial, um, identities kind of perform something or understand something or tried to understand something and make sense. And it's kind of interesting to see how they are very much similar to us in a way, um, in terms of making mistakes or not understanding what's, what's happening and then improving, constantly improving.
8.242852210998535;-19.99698257446289;6;I wish we could say the same by ourselves, but I guess we have a limit. Maybe the machines don't, but we'll see what they are. Um, anyways, it will be kind of nice for me to maybe, if that's not too much to ask to hear everyone, everyone's voice as in, if you could just say your name so that I know, I know your voice in that way, and then we'll get to some things. So whoever wants to say hi and so that I can hear them, that might be quite nice. This. Hello? Hi, I'm Peter. Hey, can you hear me right? I just got Tanya. I here, but I dunno if sounds, Sounds good, thanks. Okay, cool. Good to interact. Hi, I'm Tanya. Hi, nice to meet you. I'm on an iPhone. Is that gonna be all right?
6.395688056945801;-27.39252281188965;6;That's gonna be quite tricky. Because, well, you'll see when we get to the, the parts that's basically we'll need stereo field for the fullest effect and your iPhone was not gonna really be able, even, even if it had two microphone, two speakers, it wouldn't be physically possible because there would be too close together to really have stereo. Um, but at the same time, the thing that we're going to experience works best in a physical stereo field. So headphones as well are kind of a compromise because you can't really move through the field with, with your body and you can't, can't reposition yourself anywhere if you're wearing headphones, but if you have any he headphones or earbuds, you can try them on as well.
6.583520889282227;-27.506967544555664;6;But we'll get to that stage later and it's gonna be kind of a longish experience, I guess. So you'll be able to experiment with your settings. As I said before, the laptop, if you're on the laptop, that will kind of generate a stereo field that's physical, but you may need to be like very close to the, the center of your, of your computer, for example. So what's gonna happen? Uh, I could log on with my laptop, but there's no video. Um, I mean, it's nice to, to be able to see, um, but that is also your experience, I guess is the most important thing. So, um, but Tanya, you can have two devices as well? No. Oh. You can log, log from, login from both. Maybe you get some more, more effects on the laptop.
15.638667106628418;-18.664426803588867;6;Let me try that. That maybe I would kind of advice if you wanna really get a bit more, I, I think the phone would maybe the worst of all options we have in terms of the sound that's gonna happen in, in some time. Um, so yeah, maybe if you have time to log in through a laptop, that might be great. Headphones, as I said, will be okay to an extent, but since this is, this will have to do with psychoacoustics that may, you know, this having headphones will kind of compromise stuff a bit. So yeah, let's see what happens. Speakers are generally the best. Um, and yeah. Cool. Okay. Um, can I hear anyone else's voice?
20.962400436401367;-17.727100372314453;6;Hi, I'm May. I mean, I have laptop or a speaker or headphones. So . Okay. Which one would be a speaker is okay when? Well, I mean, I think those portable speakers can reproduce area to an extent, but you have to be very close as well. So it's like you, I would encourage you to maybe try different things as we, as the thing is happening. Okay. But also I want it to be kind of, I would like it to be kind of meditated, meditative for you. So if you feel like it's kind of working, If you were in your headphones, you don't really have to experiment with anything. Um, but at the same time, apart from being kind of a meditation, it will also be something I can, can hear me?
19.340167999267578;-10.36061954498291;6;Oh, now I can't hear. You think we lost you somehow? Yeah. No sound. See, um, this is what happens. Voices are taken away. Can anyone hear me though? Okay. Yes. Yes. Oh, okay. That's good. Yes. All good. Right? Three miles back as. Come back. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Fascinating. . It's just so weird. These things. Also, I think guys like, uh, with the, with the, if you have different sources, don't worry because there is gonna be time. Like, we're not gonna, we're gonna do some like exercises. So I think we can see what works slowly. Like don't get too caught up with this. Yeah. Oh, actually, by the way, um, is that something that everyone has to do later on with the suppression of the background noise or is it something that you do in this session, like as a host mania in terms of the, the suppress background noise?
15.737883567810059;-17.76744842529297;6;You know, remember when you were doing your, your, your walk? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember. But, um, do you think it's on now? Maybe it's just host. I really have can, can we can Aya uh, agata and maybe and I speak at the same time and we see if we can actually hear it, hear it one another. Yeah. We do this. I think it's not on to be honest, but let's try. Okay, so let's speak. I can hear Counting what's later on, so it will be very confusing I guess. But that's how we're gonna do this, I guess. Okay. Um, it was nice to hear your voice of tears as well. It's been a few days since I heard you last. Um, okay. Anyone else wants to say hi? Hi, I'm Ramona. I think we, we met at the R right online as well, but I didn't, I didn't really remember your voice, which is interesting how sometimes that memory of someone's voice is very, It's not easy to, I think the face, maybe sometimes were more, Yeah.
16.622844696044922;-19.57451057434082;6;It's easier to remember a face. Maybe easy because you were for the screen that you didn't remember voice, but the face most likely. Yeah. Cause I, I, I think I mostly saw him on his face in some meetings, but, you know, the interaction with the voice was less frequent, I guess. Mm. It's, yeah. Anyways. Okay. Uh, nice to see you again anyways, too. Um, cool. And then I heard, I heard Sarah before. Yeah. And I heard Adam's voice about the cat being poisoned and I think that's, that's all the, all the participants now. Okay, cool. So, Mm. Cool. Um, so I guess we'll start with something that may be kind of funny or weird. And it may also be interesting to, um, hear this instead of read this cuz I sent you the, the little tiny passage from Graham Harmon's book. Um, but it might be cool to hear it and then maybe if it's, if any interest just to, just to see what this experience of hearing this was like to you. And then we'll, and then we'll proceed to the, to the kind of listening and then, and then embodying being something like a trans like life transcription tool, but a, in a human version in a way.
15.994317054748535;-24.646848678588867;6;And then we'll see where it takes us. But we'll have to, um, I'm hoping that by the end of this we'll have some mat material by, with which we can, um, train an AI to do something for us and we're hyperspace. Um, but yeah. Okay. Um, I think I'm gonna try and play something now. Um, Miko? Yes. We have another participant who just joined. Maybe we should say hi to Natalia. Of course. Hello Natalia. Hello. Hi. How's it? Just on time. Finished introduction but um, would be nice to hear your voice as well see. Hello Sarah. Apologies. Um, No worries. Come back. Preparing for the annual party. So I was just installing some stuff, but anyway, I hope you are Okay. Good to have you with us. Um, so I guess we gonna leave the floor for miko to present what we gonna do. Hmm. So we're gonna actually leave the floor for someone who's with us here, and I just wanna see if we can hear that person. And I also need to make sure I'm not gonna make any feedback. Okay. So let me, Can you hear this? 1, 2, 1 2, 1 2 historian?
-19.617504119873047;2.845100164413452;6;Yes. Okay, cool. So let's have a little listen and then we'll see what happens. Historians of the tool have long noted that equipment externalizes human organs. The hammer prolongs the length and power of the human forum. The telescope one ups the eyeball, while internal combustion vehicles render obsolete the long distance function of the legs. Given what has just been said about idle and fetish, we could say that all of these devices somehow fetishize the object. This place it's usefulness and manipulability onto some external point, leaving behind the original object as a useless but gorgeous flower as an orchid, orchids are plants with atrophy, trunks and limbically cling to the rising trunks that shut out the sun flowering their huge sex organs awaiting bees for their orgasmic unions. For this reason, perhaps far from stripping objects down into calculable reservers of fuel, the progress of technology is leading us toward a completely de fetishized world, a landscape of imperative. Simul ara a planet populated with orchid like residues, PTO objects devoid of any serviceability. Lings imagines the final stage of this process in a passage of ominous beauty.
23.245784759521484;-19.868925094604492;6;Can we imagine at some future date the faculty of memory reason and decision disconnecting from the computers, which it now serves cing to be by an organ for apprehending and swollen with its own wonders becoming an organ to be apprehended, An orchid rising from the visceral and cerebral depths of cybernetic with its own power rising. It was meant to be rising into the sun. Um, okay, so, um, why does it sound like, um, Agata turned into a robot? It kind of sounds like a, Yeah, so this is interesting. Someone, Yeah, someone you might know for them, maybe. So yes, it's someone who sounds kind of like a robot, but this is basically, Yeah. So it's a clone, right? It's, it's a clone of a's voice. And it's kind of a easily accessible technology nowadays that we can have. And it's, it's obviously not, in a way, it's not perfect, but in a way it's, it's in a way perfect because, you know, the delivery's flawless and in a way, you know, it's mechanical in a way, but it's, but there's no mispronunciation or anything, and it's kind of like believable.
21.07309913635254;-25.84228515625;6;But I'm also wondering to what extent is, is it believable or, or recognizable? Because you said the gatas voice, but then it was a's, Right. So who, who thought there was a's voice in the first personalized, Let's see. Okay. Must be okay. I got confused. . No worries. Um, so I was actually thinking a lot about this. Um, if you, if, if I recorded, let's say voices of a hundred, um, let's say guys aged around 30 and one of them would be satirious and then I play them back to you, that would be the same sentence. Would you be able to really easily say that this, this one voice was satirious? This is an, like, an experiment I guess I would like to do anyways, but in this scenario. You know, we have this, um, this technology that is basically available to all of us, and you can use this for free even. Um, although for the full version, they obviously make you pay. But, um, it kind of got me interested in, in like, questions of ownership of voice or, you know, privacy as well and what is protected and what is non protected, um, in terms of, um, data.
23.629657745361328;-14.902901649475098;6;Cuz like our, um, faces are in a way protected, but not always because, you know, you go on social media and you, you could see your face there somewhere. It's just not linked to you as a human being. But is, is voice working the same way? Do you ever think of this or is it just something Yeah, it's just a voice. What is, would anyone just wanna say if they have a definition or what they think of voice is to them? I'm just curious what you might think. I guess maybe the difference is that you always able to recognize your face, but in terms of voice, I feel like I'm always taken aback of it to realize, oh, this is my voice. So there's quite a long time that takes. , you know, in order for recognition, I think. Right. That's quite strange. I don't think I perceive it the same way as space. I mean, not when you spoke about it. Yeah. But, mm-hmm. my voice, you know, , does it mean that we look at ourselves in a different way than we listen to ourselves?
23.62816047668457;-14.621757507324219;6;I think we just look at ourselves. We don't listen. Oh, it's the primary, right. Plus the way you hear yourself, isn't it different when it's recorded? Isn't it a bit different from what you hear? Yeah. Yeah. I think it's the, I think a lot of it has to do with that mediation, because we are not really able to see our face without a mirror or something. Mm-hmm. . But we see that all the time because we're surrounded by these reflective surfaces and then we're not being recorded all the time and played back. We only hear our voice like as we speak internally. Mm-hmm. . So I think that's why there's a bigger feeling of alienation. Maybe sometimes when you hear your voice play, but cause you're just not used to it as much as you're used to seeing your face in the mirror every day. Mm-hmm. . I think so. I how, Yeah, Sorry. No, no. Please have, I have a question. Do, do, do I remember right when that they say that every voice is distinct? Everyone's voice is different if they're different in the individual, that there are no same voices out there. Well, so see, this is an interesting question because again, what is the voice?
24.392297744750977;-20.317773818969727;6;Is it just the mechanical sound of, uh, coming from here or is it the whole Amal game of, you know, your dialect, your, where you're from, et cetera? If it, I remember one of my professors, one, like a long time ago, said if you kind of chopped one's head off and you just heard the noise that is being produced by the, the vocal chords, it would be just like a boring, uh, and there'll be nothing there. But even the shape of your teeth and how big a tongue is, and every, if you're sick or if you're healthy, stuff like that will, you know, will change your voice. And your voice changes almost on a daily basis. Like your voice is different in the morning, that it's in the evening as well. So it's kind of this strange, fluctuating thing. And yeah, some, it's kind of interesting because you can, you can kind of easily see a reflection of yourself as wind as in, in the mirror, but then to really hear. The same, um, experience. You would have to be kind of, you know, in a cathedral maybe, and then kind of shout and then listen back to the reverberation or maybe in the mountains and you hear an echo of your voice.
14.550318717956543;7.106523036956787;6;It will also sound different from where you hear and in your head. Um, so I just wanted to ask a, how did you feel when you, when you heard the clone, do you, do you have the same sensation as if you were hearing a recording or is it like even weirder? What, what is your sensation? No, I mean, I think it's weirder because I know I've never said these sentences. I've actually never even read the text. So it's almost like you haven't read the text. Well, it's, well, but it said that we're gonna read it together, so, you know. Sorry. No, I scanned it, but I didn't read like, you know, from just scanned. But, uh, yeah, I mean I think definitely it's weird, like it's not the first time you, you did that. Like you sent me something some months ago as well, that was like a sample from my voice and then something I never said. So it wasn't the first time I heard this, but definitely it's like, I dunno, it's like, it's definitely weird there because you have this awareness that you haven't.
27.530134201049805;2.8149328231811523;6;So it's like, you know, that you've been like a part of you has been taken and used to like, so, So I guess like, I guess it stops belonging to you because you know that like this voice can say anything. Like, you can make me essentially in some way say anything and that's okay. So is it still you or is it again a new kind of identity in a way? Or maybe, I think so, but the new identities would still be me. Like I don't think this one excludes the other. I think it's like an extension. Okay. What if it said my name is Martha or something, It doesn't matter. Again, it's like a different identity, but I guess, yeah. Okay. Like what's the source? It's like what you said about the, like this, this whole question of original, you know, like, I mean I know it's different because this is me and like how I define my being. Mm-hmm. , but then I dunno. I think it gives like it's, it might be scary, but on the other hand it's like gives you an opportunity to, to become something different altogether. Like I think if you got clowned and someone looked like you, I think in some ways it's quite similar when you hear someone speaking, like, I can imagine seeing someone on the street speaking with my voice that's like, that's crazy.
23.446147918701172;-23.958436965942383;6;And I think if my machine does this, in some ways, some of these feelings are similar. So this is an interesting point because if you wanted to, you could technically meet someone who would be speaking your voice, because there's a way to donate your voice for people who cannot speak, and then they use a computer software to basically use your voice. And then maybe if there are any recordings of the back, maybe when they could speak. Now we're talking about people who are, um, you know, um, basically having some, um, some real neurological problems or stuff like that. Um, then yeah, they can, can speak with your voice, but with a slight twist, I guess. But I don't know if you like, this is another interesting and kind of fascinating, um, thing that's basically opening up where, where voice donation is gonna be kind of like blood donation in a way. Um, but yeah, I was kind of thinking about this in terms of the text as well. Like we, I, I selected this little page, not, not only to just hear a's clone read it, but also just to think of what an actual clone could be in terms of. You know, like our, an extension of us in, in through technol technology in a way.
21.877227783203125;-19.194643020629883;6;Like we are kind of becoming androids of some kind. And this is another, you know, back, back before we had microphones and we had, um, speakers and that, that would be the extension. But now this clone is something to me, I feel is something else is like a different kind of similar, um, I dunno if you did any, did anyone think, like, if you read the text, did you have any thoughts about voice or is it, as it refers to this, maybe we go back to this, but if anyone had anything in mind, it would be kind cool to hear. Just something quickly. I was thinking of vent. Vent. I conce a word. We have the, I can ask on your hand. Okay. I say, I just say Yes useful. That's my extension there. But, but please, please continue. I just, I'm just gonna make this on your hand and without moving your mouse, the puppy will mm-hmm. be another character.
25.04252815246582;-25.93013572692871;6;So that's what I'm thinking of, like that in relation to the extension of human, um, or body, um, that, but that's like another body in a way that you create a dialogue with, with yourself, with a puppet. So, and that's personally, that's what I'm interested in. I do wanna learn that. Mm-hmm. without your mouse moving. Um, like a magic trick that's, I think that's in relation to, think of AI that like duplicate in a way of your voice and say something else. Uh, I think it's another way of controlling, but also like a surrendering kind of relationship with how with ai, Um, yeah. Yeah. I saw a ventriloquist, uh, show, uh, over the summer and the guy was actually controlling two other people instead of a puppet.
20.09138298034668;-25.95635986328125;6;So he kind of, they were, they weren't kind of like volunteers, but he was pressing on some pressure points on their hands and just asking them to open their mouths. And then he was basically using two voices and they can of had a conversation, but it was, wasn't their voices obviously. It was kind of scary how quickly he could really control them because somehow the correlation of this pressure point and the mouth was very easy for them to really perform as well. And it was, they really became other people in a way. So, um, I guess with AI was gonna be, It may be similar. Um, Okay. I'm not gonna ask a's clone to say the word unless anyone wants to hear it later. Um, but yeah. Cool. Um, so I was, I keep hearing myself somewhere, but it's, I dunno where it's coming from. Anyways, Um, I, I guess, so the task we kind of have is to, to, in a way combine our voices or your voices and become in a way the voice of hyperspace of, of your collective, um, space that you create as human beings. I only see you behind the screen, but I believe you may be indeed real human beings. Um, it's gonna, I'm, I'm sorry, the zoom thing is, I don't really, it's very difficult for me to really understand, but anyways,
21.030752182006836;-22.652164459228516;6;Um, so I thought it would be kind of an interesting thing and also maybe a good thing to, um, if you think of this in a meditative way, to kind of try to become. If we all try to become a live transcription device, each of us individually, and I would like to basically play you in some words, and I'm not gonna tell you what the words are, and some of them will not really be real words or anything. Um, some of them will be, but they will maybe sound, I dunno. Um, not, not the usual way. I dunno if anyone's like, I dunno who's familiar with the idea of phantom words? Okay, cool. Um, so basically it's kind of a interesting phenomenon that this one scholar Diana Deut noticed some time ago and it kind of came from the whole electronic voice phenomena, um, thing that was a, a thing back in the sixties, I guess, people were, had like the recordings of, I don't know, that would be an interview with someone from the Rolling Stones and in the noise floor of the recording, people would kind of perceive.
23.850818634033203;-20.874534606933594;6;Different words as if maybe it goes to a speaking in between someone else's speech or stuff like that. Um, it's called evp, like, like the whole phenomenon is called evp. You can look it up online. I, I guess with examples as well. But then this is obviously a function of our brain to recognize speech as a kind of a thing that is, you know, we are really drawn to speech in a way. Not even like voice as well, but if you hear something like speech, I don't think there is anything quite like it in, in our world of like what we perceive normally. Speech is not, you know, a flower is not really speaking to you the same way speech speaks to you because we have all these constants, vowels, and different sounds, rhythms. And so kind of to play in that idea, um, I would like to play some sounds to you and these will be exercises and understanding phantom words basically. And it will be cool. I, I thought we could do this so that we generate material that we can later on, if you feel that is okay later on, kind of perform together and record this, and then we'll use this material to train in AI to, to be the collective voice.
20.055755615234375;-23.634082794189453;6;So was like, we don't, I don't know, I don't really know what's gonna happen, but it's not gonna sound like any individual voice you might have as a human over there. And so I hope No, no, like there's no privacy being compromised or anything. Um, but we'll get to that stage later on as well. Maybe we discussed this as well. Um, so yeah, as I said before, it might be cool if you have speakers in front of you, um, at least laptop speakers. And then I'm gonna play this and I'm not gonna talk over it, and it's gonna be, I don't know, maybe 15 minutes. We'll see how long it takes. But, um, it would be cool if you, if you're on headphones so you can experiment and maybe take them off and listen to your laptop and then go back and see if anything changes. But basically the whole principle of this is going to be that you will hear different loops of different word like sounds, and you will. If you kind of relax in a way, you will slowly start hearing that your brain is kind of maybe turning to one of one side of the stereo field and maybe hearing something there.
15.77817440032959;-20.4654598236084;6;And then maybe some words will as phantoms, they will emerge even though they're not there. And it may be interesting if you, you know, like I'm from Poland, so a lot of the sounds I hear the voice, the words I pick up are actually polish even. They're totally not this. So wherever you're from the, the, the words you hear, maybe this and that's cool. Like, it might be cool to train an AI speaking in English to know some languages. And so, we'll, we'll, we'll, it might be cool afterwards to maybe have a strategy of how to really approach this, but we'll, we'll need to kind of record something of 10, 15 minutes later on, but, Okay. Um, cool. Um, I'm just gonna do a test, um, to see if everyone can hear my computer.
9.86898422241211;-19.684545516967773;6;Um, Okay. And might turn off my video. This, you can still hear my voice. Right? Cool. Okay. And then can you hear. This sound. Okay. And then can you hear how it changes from left to right? Okay. Can I hear this? Okay, cool. Um, okay, so let's just start with something and then see what happens. Um, and it's just gonna be a continuous flow of different things happening and whatever you pick up on, it'd be cool to, if, if you write it down, if you don't pick up on anything, maybe try and change your position. You can also, if you're on speakers or if you're listening to your laptop, you can kind of move your head around to see what changes. If you're on headphones, you will not ha not hear any changes If you move your head, obviously, but, but then you, you may still hear something, but overall, try to relax and, and just if you hear anything, just write it down.

Uh, I mean work, I mean, it's, it's something I just made for this, um, Well, it could be, it could be a thing. It's, it's, it could be. I dunno. But, um, I'm curious if you heard any words that, and I'm curious how if we all gonna come together in the same words.
15.599778175354004;-22.34164047241211;6;Are we gonna have different words or, Oh, I have a list from man. Yeah. See, I have a, I have a list as well. Very cool. This is a very long list. Very cool. Okay. Yeah, I have three pages long, a long list. Okay. That's great. Um, I'm just looking at a's list and, Oh, are you insulting me? Aya . Lots of polish I can see. But it's funny because we, I don't have anything yet that you have. Okay. So would anyone want to read like the ten first words and then we will proceed and then we'll see if we have the same? When you say words, do you, do you mean recognizable words or words? That might not mean anything. It's fine if you just hear some gibber. It's just totally cool because it's, you know, it's something, Um, so, so, yeah. Do you wanna, do you wanna give us your, your, your, a few of yours? Sure.
7.396031379699707;-13.877302169799805;6;Umba voice me, uh, stood as as, as stood, um, and going on other things. And that's probably really, yeah. Okay. Um, do you have, so do you have something that is like easily understandable in, in English or was that not something that was happening? Pay for pay fee. Repay free days. Free dayday rebates. Free days. I have free days. Did anyone have free days? Yeah, me too. Three days. Yeah. And three days. Yeah, I have both. Both three and three. Yeah. And three beans Yeah. I also had free babe. Um, I dunno what that means. Cool. Um, okay. Anyone else? Sorry, I had free base. Me too. Nice. Pre base. Yeah, I have that one. But pre, No, I had pre, pre What is the pre base? I like that have pre base as well and free base. I have threes. I've got lot of Italian words in it. I, I have eski. Yeah. I have too. Which is a Polish word. I don't have, Nobody's also Italian for eski means Germans. Yeah. Right. And oh, so it, Yeah. It's revealing something interesting. Okay. It's so true that the na mother tank Yeah. Is more visible. Mm-hmm. takes over. Right. So, so much swear words. So really Wow. It also three days in Chinese in different dialect.
16.074813842773438;-22.545751571655273;6;Wow. a different dialect compare like southern dialect and also Mandarin of three days. Wow. For all three days. So that's interesting. That's cool. Um, it slipped in and out of a well accent for me. coming on really strong and I couldn't get rid of it. Un sculpted. Um, yeah, I tried at some point because I had like a lot of Polish words and I tried to be like, no English now, but then it wouldn't, and then some at some point it would like, it was strange. Mine changed portugese at some point as well. Just quite funny fact. It says your name Sarah Lot. My name. I didn't hear my name. Rodriguez. You heard Rodriguez? I didn't hear Rodriguez. That's funny. Um, yeah, I'm looking at Anus list and it's, there is a lot of, um, English as well. I, I might, I might just share it with everybody if that's okay with you. Yeah, that's fine. No, it's fine. It's fine. Okay. I'm just gonna paste this. Um, well that's all that you had, right? Yeah. Okay. So. So, let's see. I see persona. That was one of the actual words being played. Did, did everyone get persona? No. Yeah, I have, I have persona. Yeah. Okay. So you, so some of these words were actual words being played. Some of them were kind of like juer, soll of something.
21.012054443359375;-21.388050079345703;6;Some of them were words spoken by, let's say, I actually had a Portuguese, what you had that was saying something in English, and then I was using that word. I don't know if it's played, but it was, there were some words with with, with wrong accents saying something. I, I also use a Polish artificial voice saying something in English. And it sounds like, not like the word, but, So it's kinda interesting to see. Cool. I mean, you know, it's, it's kind of a thing. It's, it's, it's nice, um, psychoacoustic effect. It's, it's an auditory illusion. That's what it's called by, by this person. If you're interested in Diana DT is her name. Um, but yeah. Um, I actually did this today and I had, um, this app called ATA listening to these, and it was also trying to make sense of what was being, what was happening.
22.133705139160156;-19.591054916381836;6;It was changing. It's mine, which is kind of interesting. I, we playing the same word and I would change the position of the computer and the transcription software thought, heard something else. And I had lists of where, like Jeff chat something. So it's interesting that, you know, the, like the life transcription, the ai, the algorithm are really working hard to understand something overall. So did you say that the, the positioning changed the outcome? Yes. Um, and it's because, you know, because we're in a physical, it's almost like a swimming in language in a way. Yeah. And if you're just changing your position slightly, like I, I could be doing leaning backwards and forwards and the word would change to something else. Yes. That's, And it's interesting that it's what I was doing because I have these two speakers, um, my, um, like level of my head. And so I would be walking along. and sometimes it would be so much easier to hear where we're just standing just next to one instead of being in between. Mm-hmm. . Yeah. Positioning changed it changed it completely, completely.
22.051511764526367;-21.089845657348633;6;So basically how it works in terms of like tech, the technical aspect of it is quite simple. You have the one word being played in two separate speakers in two separate channels. So panned all the way left and all the way right. But then there has to be an offset so that the foreseeable, um, so we have the left speaker is saying something like, um, on a persona, persona is tricky cuz it has three syllables. But if you have something like with two syllables, then there has to be an opposite of a syllable between the words. And then so that when, let's say we have the word nowhere at on the where syllable, the other, the one, the other one's saying no, and then that big builds this rhythm. That's kind of, you know, um, I, I wish we could, you know, it would be kind of interesting to play one word for a longer amount of time. But I wanted to get as much as possible and it's kind of, I mean, I mean it kind of proved that there is something and that we kind of, you know, we are, we are, we kind of share a grammar in a way as humans. And it's something that's. I guess, yeah, interesting that this happens with language with that has some cognitive content because this is probably the same phenomenon.
20.47098731994629;-20.955720901489258;6;It happens with pure sound called beating that when the frequency of sound to sound is just slightly different and when we hear them at the same time, something else happens inside the brain. So this could be, this is something that happens with this words as well. In a way it could be a thing because, um, you know, there is, even in the shortest word, there is a melody and the frequency is changing and it's, it's obviously much, the spectrum is much broader than thes wave, like in, in vinyl beat. But still you'll have the interpolation of these, um, sound waves. So this could be, you know, operating on a very minute level of a few herds that you saw may these changes. Um, I don't know if it got you into any mood as well in terms of meditative state, but, you know, um, I guess it could overall if you, if you really practiced this for longer I guess.
19.87225341796875;-22.815099716186523;6;But, um, Cool. Um, so, so it would be nice, I mean, I think I'm gonna. Um, make a few, um, attempts at creating that mute, like this collective clone of, of our voices. And it's nice that we, we already, I think since this is recording, I can maybe even use the recording somehow, but it would be nice if we could collectively, um, read some stuff and maybe try and synchronize in a way. So we have a lot, lot, a lot of text. We, we have half an hour, so we only, we, we need a round of, we, we need around 15 minutes, maybe 10 minutes of recording of our voices. And it may be interesting to see how to do it because we, you all have a list of words, but they will be, you know, if some of us are, you know, some, some of us have polish and Italian and everything. So I'm thinking, Yeah, I'm, this is something I wanted to also ask you. If you were to speak collectively in different tongues, in different rhythms, or maybe there's a way to find your own, like a collective rhythm, how would you, how do you think you would like to approach this? Would you like to maybe go word by word and try and sync even though you're saying the a different thing, but then kind of sync, um, in time?
13.726641654968262;-21.78465461730957;6;Or would you like to just have a list of words that we all. Recognize, and then we, we read them as well. I'm not gonna read anything cuz it's your voice, but yeah. So the main idea is to be in sync. That's what needs to happen. That's think it will be very, very good to have some stuff that is in sync because when I'm gonna ask the AI to, when I'm gonna train, try to train the ai, it will, it is most likely that will be happy when there is some synchronicity in terms of delivery and maybe words as well. So, because we all have probably drastically different texts, which is interesting, um, we could somehow, I mean I wish I had some kind of algorithm to, to like run it, run, run through your, your words and then quickly fish out the ones that we all have and share. But I don't have that kind of algorithm technology with me, so, So yeah.
13.861661911010742;-20.2040958404541;6;Any ideas? Shall we just, shall we just try and find a, a pace at which we all collect, collectively read what we have, and then, and then it will be difficult as well, because we all have different latencies with our connections, you know? So, and then you'll be hearing others interrupting you in a way, but it will all be kind of recorded and perhaps, perhaps something will emerge and, you know, we'll see. Um, it may be good to also, it probably something that I will ask each to do maybe afterwards, is to just record your own voice, saying your own, your own words on your phone, and then maybe share the recordings with, with, uh, Agata so that if, if a collective reading doesn't really render a voice, we'll have your individual voices there will kind of synchronize a bit more in post production.
17.41314697265625;-17.713647842407227;6;And then we'll have something. But I think we can maybe try something. Maybe there isn't a dialogue. Maybe we can read word by word and see what happens. Then what do you feel? Hmm. Yes. Let, let's, let's just try. Hmm. Okay. And I guess we need someone maybe you to give us some kind a rhythm or read it first and then I'd in a minute. Sorry. Is that correct? We'll wait. Um, thank you. Yeah. Um, I'm gonna, I'm gonna try, you know, I don't want to give a cue because that will, that will be in the recording, I guess in of some kind. So perhaps if you just all, um, if you can have, do you see a, Okay, so even if I go, if I have my stopwatch, I see seconds and perhaps somehow this is the, the pace, right? Because we live in, in real time, and it doesn't mean that we have to say a word every second. Mm-hmm. , but this is the cure, right? Um, 2, 3, 4. Mm-hmm. Maybe somehow we can sync to just time. But then I guess, I guess, you know, maybe it's, it's better if someone starts to read and then slowly one by one we join.
18.53388214111328;-21.30117416381836;6;Yeah. That's why I thought, I think its gonna be easier because then it's, because then we can all try and synchronize. So either maybe a GTA or a, If you wanna start reading, reading your list, and then obviously we just read it in circle. You read it. How, what? Like we, once we finish, we just reread. Um, we can, we can try and do one run through and then some peoples will be, I don't think, Yes, and I think people will be catching up. Okay. So I, I think give it, you know, if you feel like you're in sync, you can continue. I feel like if you feel like it's over, maybe it's over. You know, we, it's, We'll see what happens. I guess. I guess, I guess this is interesting as well. Um, what, what you do about the language issue? Like, for example, I think I, I really think we, you should stick with, we should all stick with our, you know, like if you have something in Polish, just read it in Polish and we'll see what we we're really see what the AI makes of this.
17.01702117919922;-21.791309356689453;6;It may be a really strange thing. We not, we are not reading one text. No, we're reading each of our. Ah, ah, for example, I've repeated quite a lot of words. I shouldn't read the repeats, right? I should just read them once. Ideally. Um, I think that's up to you. Um, if you, if you like, if you have three a four pages of dog, then maybe, well, maybe that's, that's it. I don't know. Yeah. But if you feel, you know, rhythm and repetition is also an extremely important part of, you know, communicating anyway. So I think that's cool. And sorry, just one thing. Can it be like two words? Cause the way I heard it was words. Sometimes it's okay. Right? As long as I keep the pace and I can just, Okay.
13.500202178955078;-19.803939819335938;6;Yeah. I think, And like, if you find a rhythm, you know, think of it kind of, you know, it's kind of a musical exercise in a way, a rhythmic exercise. But I'm sure we can deliver something rhythmical. And I'll be just, I'll be just here and, and I'll record this in my stuff as well. Sorry, I missed the initial bit. What, um, what's so, so either a GTA or annual will start, they read the words in a pace that's kind. Maybe corresponds to second passing. Okay. So the steady, slower slowish pace got, but however you feel. So IGA will start, I dunno who wants to start. Um, but they will start and then everybody can slowly join in if you feel comfortable with this.
13.271249771118164;-17.900577545166016;6;And then we'll towards, at some point we'll have a collective voice somehow. We'll see. Maybe not. We'll see. Yeah, I just, I, I, I was also taking notes of the things I was hearing, but beyond the voices, so just making actual notes, like I hear my logical Pedro, things like that. Dunno if I should read those, my actual notes perhaps. Um, you know, this is, this is something up to you. Okay. Maybe, maybe in the process you will start hearing something else as well, because the voices will kind of blend together in, in a strange, glitchy way. And maybe there's something else that you would want to add spontaneously in this course as well. I don't think we, we have to have any strict rules. Right. That cool? Um, okay. So if, who wants to start? Let's do it. You want to start already? Okay. So I start. Okay. No slow. Huh? Go slow. Don't, don't rush too much. Okay. Okay. Part work. We must much We Maru bud. Yeah. Wow. Daily dating, reading. Every days rebate base rebates. We, I guess designers, he wants me wants, she was three the me mesh this week. He wants me.
21.95258140563965;-22.989444732666016;6;The mesh design is three to three days. Episode daisy, three days last epi, three days. Three days designs mesh. Um, yes, she so. Cause I cause a K. Oh, you know, like, like having hearing this, I dunno what's the word? It's kind of really kind of clumped together and then falling apart and obviously there is so much of the Zoom sound interfering. It kind of sounded like a, yeah, like some kind of an Android that is broken and it's not managing to find them. The voice is to speak in, which is very interesting. Um, so this is something I will, it's, it's shortish, but I will, I will maybe make duplicates of that. And maybe I'll also ask, so series is to give me the recording of the sound from the actual Zoom thing. Yeah, that might be kind of interesting. Um, Very good. Lemme just have this left. Look at this. Okay. And there's one thing that we can read collectively, sorry. And, and that I will have to use, um, to gen to train the ai, which is kind of a disclaimer that the application asks for. And so, okay, so the, the, the, the text reads, um, I'm just gonna send this as a collective message to everybody.
22.678375244140625;-23.976083755493164;6;So it reads, I hereby verify, deny hyperspace, I'm currently speaking, and that I'd like script to create an overdub version of my voice. Um, so. This is something I need to submit when I submit the data for, for the thing. I, it, it's an interesting thing because in a way it's kind of a, again, like a data protection thing and or privacy, but at the same time it doesn't really mean that much in a way. Um, but I will have to have this as a audio file. So, um, I'm thinking whether we could all, uh, maybe read this one by one and then have this recorded and then I'll just match them together, um, later on and then Yeah. Would that be okay? Un unless someone feels like this is already, you know, becoming a, a dangerous territory where you know your voice is becoming data that you give away to somebody and you don't know me like a knows me, Some people here know me, but maybe I'm just a freak and I'm stealing your data. What if we, um, read it all together like I here by verify that. So like word by word. Yeah. I think that's cool. And let's see if you can synchronize, because we can do like times or so, so that sounds cool. Take the pace. Yeah. And would, um, Okay. Is there anybody on their phone at the moment or are you all or your computers?
16.674972534179688;-19.002588272094727;6;And you could technically also record this on your phone while we're doing this, because that would be a better quality recording. Okay. So if we had, if we could do this, you know, in, in like voice memo or something, just say Okay. But if, if, if every sort of beat we say one word, then that would help. Yeah. Instead of kinda Yeah. I think, I think that that can be kind of easily done. Yeah. But if, yeah. So we, we'll record this via Zoom, but also it'll be nice to have nicer recordings. Um, and so then I, if you have, if you could, it would be very nice if you could, after this in your own, um, time record your, your words from the Phantom so that maybe I can also match them together and maybe have a few different versions of the hyperspace voice.
17.456134796142578;-14.434264183044434;6;Okay. So you probably need a, kinda like a Bs, right? Maybe like a 3, 2, 1 I here by something like that. Okay. How, how would you read the word hyperspace? Hybrid space. , not too fast. Hyperspace. So every word in one bts, that was the idea, but okay. Hybrid, yeah. Has to be a bit slow. Maybe hybrid you, you don't really have any words like this com population or anything, so I guess, I guess this should be doable. Okay. So yeah, take it away. Okay. Three. To, uh, Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Do you wanna do the count in maybe? Yes. You, Well, I can. Is everybody'll the candidate? 3, 2, 1. iSpace currently speaking and I'd like create, used to create like my, my. Always nice. We can slow down so much. Maybe we should try slower, because everyone was afraid to be the first one to start the next word. So we slowing you, you've got the strongest voice going for it. Halfway through I was like your head. So . So, but this is cool because towards the end you're really kind, almost synchronized, even though you know, the internet is, isn't obviously a big obstacle.
18.53529167175293;-14.253129005432129;6;So maybe, maybe you wanna do it again, but very slowly mm-hmm. . Okay. And so maybe I, maybe one of you gives you Okay. I, I can do the tempo as well, but yeah. Okay. Maybe I'll do it. Do And just one word. One. Yeah. If it's just one letter, we just like, I, No, I, Okay, but what about I. I think that's, I, I thought maybe we can continue as well once we read it, because it seems like we're getting the good space at the end. We can still continue again. So we read it twice? Yeah. Mm-hmm. . Okay. Yeah, maybe twice. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Let's do it, Let's do it twice and I'll, I'll do the count in right now. Okay. So one, Okay. Three. Okay. 3, 2, 1. Um, I agree. Hi, Chris. Chris, currently speaking, understand that this, this. B used to create.That sounds like voice. Voice. Bye live to create.
31.87702178955078;-3.159966468811035;6;Oh my voice. B, use nice work. Nice. So funny because it really started to sound like, like really robotic . So you are becoming some kind of technology as we speak in a way. It's super interesting. Um, cool. What did you think of this experience then? Cool. Quite uneasy. I just like, Holding your temp, like your pace and then each time I thought, I'm going slower. It felt like it's even slower than that. Mm-hmm. interesting. Yeah, maybe a group. It was, it was quite strange how I actually heard black people synchronously when normally you can't really do choir singing in Zoom cuz everyone's at different temple's. Sort of like a different, So that was quite impressive. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I quite like the zoom delay actually. I think that quite, I didn't know where we, if we were really uny or if it was the connection, you know? And sometimes I could hear glimpse of voices of voices coming . It's quite nice. I think. I think that's gonna be kind of if, if the, I don't know exactly what's gonna happen in the process of training the ai, but I think that it's actually interesting to work with the sand that we have through Zoom and like through all these different mangling of, of, of your voices and your acoustic spaces as well.
23.424251556396484;-24.970678329467773;6;And then, you know, we really see what's, what's gonna happen. Um, so, so yeah. Now do you feel that. Now that you're, you're kind of giving this data away, do you feel like nothing happened?  Or do you maybe have some concerns that Oh, yeah. My, my voice, my biometric data. My voice is being given away. And, and is it, Yeah. How do you feel about this? I'm not gonna use it in any, any, any way. Of course. Um, and ob obviously, because we have the line saying hyperspace, like, I hyperspace, it's, it's not gonna be legally possible. I guess that would be very illegal, but, Yeah. Does it, is it, do you feel like overall you have a problem with any data being compromised or especially some biometric data or voice? It feels more like in kind of interjects the, uh, the database of, um, what's it called, the script. Mm-hmm. , Um, by creating this mish mesh of voices doesn't belong to anyone. Yeah. Um, just, just so you know, of course, no one else is gonna be able to use this. It's not like a, I mean, they would have to be stealing data  from us in a very blatant way.
24.03083038330078;-24.608606338500977;6;Way. So, so overall, I'm just gonna create this voice and then this is gonna be used for. For the hyper space. So, so it's kind of safe. But yeah, this whole process, I think it's, um, it's interesting that these identities will, you know, I mean, it's one way, it's one, one way to think about this stuff as like deep fakes and everything, but it's another when, when this really becomes something that lives on it own in a way. But yeah, and I'm interested to see what kind of freedoms come out of it. Um, and I imagine this kind have lot of CNT assets and tease because the zoom recording, so it'd be quite interesting to see, especially after you played, um, your piece can, it's, it is very rhythmical and, but all the rhythms change depending on the tone of voice. Uh, so I wonder how, how one will be maybe like, yeah, very, uh, high hat drum machine, but quite interesting to experiment that. I read. See, I mean, I, I think the AI really fills in a lot, um, of that voice data. So like it actually will strive to generate speech, so it may just sound weird, um, but it will probably even have a proper accent and it will deliver stuff.
24.569175720214844;-18.07509422302246;6;We'll see, I mean, to be honest, I based the, like I based anus clone on the reading that she did for our project that we did together, and she read in the way that you would read the text. So it was kind of very little intonation. It was kind of, kind of flat and delivery and made the pace I think was, was preserved and the intonation as well. So we'll see, because now we had kind of robotic stuff as well, but also noisy stuff. So I, I really can't say what's gonna happen, but I'm sure we're gonna get something. So, Yeah. Um, it's, it's very interesting in the context of this project because with Aya we were talking a lot about giving agency away, starting the whole thinking about the project with creating some kind of entity that could be some kind of an algorithmic AI curator or taking over control over, over the material we want to publish online. And this kind of gets completed with creating this voice, this giving agency away, creating this entity outside of our group. Just like where, when we were, um, pro processing our previous transcript using the open AI API language model, kind of giving, giving this our space that we create here another voice that is in the end, a mix of, of our, all of our voices, but still, still mediated through a machine. Um, this would be very, very interesting.
6.733537673950195;13.847868919372559;6;Hmm. Yeah. And I was also thinking in relation to the text that you shared mm-hmm. , because I was thinking about, uh, these tools as objects, uh, I mean objects as extension of our being. And then when I was thinking about what kind of object is this voice, what form in this material material they mentioned, does it take, And then I thought that the object of the, the voice is an extension is actually space. Because voice is space, and space is material just like all the other objects. It just contains all the objects. And then in interestingly, this, yeah, hyper voice, this cl voice interestingly, kind of relates with what hyperspace that is, this mix of different spaces in one space or different, different layering of different spaces.
18.16590690612793;-20.271108627319336;6;Um, so this, I think a lot, a lot to be think through with, with what we've just done. Yeah. I hope, Yeah, I hope there was, there was some, some, it's, it was an experience to, uh, to have a think about overall. But I guess it would, I'm just, just to close, I would just ask if you, if you can, if you, if you're willing to, to, to re to. Your lists again, just so that we, maybe we can experiment with what the AI can do, and then your spaces will still be pronounced, uh, if we mix them together, um, your individual recordings, and then maybe we can, uh, maybe I can build something that, you know, encompasses both your individual recordings if you read your lists and, and what we had via Zoom. But it shouldn't be too long, like in a few days, a, a voice should appear and, and I'll, I'll share it with everybody in some way. And, and yeah, thanks for that. Its almost like we were the collective group against this one voice. So I would like this idea of what it's to interfere with ai. Is it a group thing?
24.231538772583008;-23.75823211669922;6;Is it a collective thing? And yeah. That's all, you know, what we are doing here with iPad space. So that could be, Yeah. I mean, I'm looking forward to see what's going come out. Mm-hmm. all of us against one voice. Well, I it's gonna be one, but it may we'll see how it really maybe reproduce your, your, your, your timbers in a way accurate. Like I could hear. So, because that, because when you were reading in a synchronous way, Synchronous way, Yes. Um, Like the, the statement, I could actually hear kind of like a choir of, of, of voices. So it had a very distinct thing. If the AI was able to reproduce that, that would be cool. Let's see what happens. But yeah, I think quickly I thinking what if the, um, once the, the sound, the AI voice is created from the collective, the, the, the input, um, if the, like thinking of the copyright, um, that line we just read, so would that have a copyright? Like what if that's voice is put into use and say something and that, I feel like just that's, there's a lot of possibility.
23.20231819152832;-17.06095314025879;6;Can say many, many things, um, from that collective voice. Mm-hmm. , I think this is a very interesting, um, aspect because there isn't really copyright on, on, on voice. There is data protection, but there isn't really copyright. If you read a statement and recorded that is a recording, so technically that recording could be copyrighted, but because it's not original because you're reading someone else's, in a way it's not, it's very, it's it's an area of law in sound and, and, and, and. And music as well, that is very, um, kind of wishy washy and no one really knows what's, what's up. So I don't really know. Like there's no, there's no trademark. You can re trademark your voice as a thing because it's given to you. It's kind of strange. But there is data protection in a way. Voices, if, if, if someone can re recognize from the sound of your voice that this is you, and then this is somehow played somewhere in a way that could be really easily linked to you, then in a way, this could be a data protection violation, but we never are reading in this, this scenario.
-3.919020414352417;17.494117736816406;6;I guess if anyone, any of you screen in the street and then someone played the sound and then there will be a picture of you somewhere else in the building that would still, no, no one would then be, be able to trace that there is a new data and protection or violation happening. So it's a, this is really weird thing, you know, this is, this is really interesting with the voice because, uh, machines, cange, images, et cetera, fingerprint, but not the voice, because I think AI still does not recognize this there, there is no mathematical, uh, kind of representation like for frequency, like pitch, et cetera, a volume.
26.062034606933594;-19.196107864379883;6;There is no category for the ta. It, it, I think it's just something multidimensional that it can be put into zero and one, one binary kind of computations. And because everyone's voice is unique, it's still maybe too vague for it to really recognize it. I mean, yeah. You know, it's, it's kind of early days. It's early days of this technology being like accessible. But I'm sure you know, when you, when you really watch like deep fake videos, sometimes, you know, they're, they're made in a way that you would never even think it's deep fake, it's already so good and with sound, you know, it's, it's, and like human voices is probably gonna be the same thing, whether it's scary or not. Like this is actually the, the second paragraph of that. Really. I don, I dunno if I think it's gonna happen. I don't think, No, it's, it's still not so intelligent. This, well it's not intelligent, but people in a way, uh, think they are. So we'll see what they come up with very soon. . Yeah, there was that Netflix document, uh, what was called the Andy Warhol.
23.95223045349121;-19.46714210510254;6;Did you see that one there was narrated with the, the fake voice of Andy Warhol. And that sounded, it sounded pretty convincing sometimes you would hear, you know, that kind of. Stretch in the voice is little, like bit stretched, but very little. It was bit mad, but again, I dunno how we sounded like, So it could just means someone else. Yeah. Um, with, with very little postproduction, you can actually add more, you know, intonation to the, to the CL voice if you wanted to. It's not very difficult as well and maybe, you know, most likely the Netflix producers had Yeah. In a better tool. So, and it also really depends on maybe, I think how you deliver the recording. So if I was like, there is another application that asks you to read specific phrases and there will be questions and everything. So perhaps they have a different algorithm and they only use this specific kind of, um, Kind of script, but with this one there is more freedom. So I guess it's kind of an interesting tool to see what happens in this scenario.
25.29936408996582;-23.202957153320312;6;I hope something happens . Um, does it change anything? If we have that uh, AI voice coming out of this collective voices and then we train that again, will that change anything? That, would it put you further to be more accurate? Um, depiction of the corrective voice, That's, I guess that's something to be, to be seen. Like we could run this many times almost like thinking of like, I dunno if you know some of, most of you or some of you know, Alvin, the csp, I'm sitting in a room. If you did this with the script and you played it back and back, back in forth or something, Yeah, that'd be quite interesting to see. Yeah. So maybe voice Yeah. Something could happen. So I'll, I'll run some experiments, I'll let you know what happens. I'll, I'll generate a few voices for sure. And maybe there will be a few voices overall that will be used for hyperspace as well. Yeah. Could they say, No, we are not doing this. We behave collective perhaps. Yeah. It was very nice to. Work with you on this. Thank you for participating. Thank you so much. Thank you. Cool. Thank you. Thank you. It was, it was very interesting. Thank you. Maybe have some camile tea now and relax Um, great. Um, you know what, I, I really can't wait to hear this. Our new voice in space somewhere in space. Hmm. Right. I think when you, when you just, when you said something about voices space, it, it could be really a nice idea to play with, with what's happening with like, in terms of real, like, nice spatial audio scenarios with like many different sources of sound happening.
5.182358741760254;-13.951422691345215;6;We'll see. Maybe we, maybe this is taken, this won't be taken summer. We'll see what happens. Mm. But yeah, it's up to you I guess, cuz it's your voice. Yeah. And then we can record it again. You can make it, say whatever it want you want. We'll see. Um, great. Cool. Any ideas? So nice to see everyone after the break and next time we will see you a lot sooner than the last time. We are thinking of having the next session on the, on Friday the 30th, aif At this, the end of this month, we, we still need to confirm the next, uh, visitor to a group part. We should have it soon. And what day did you say that? It's Friday the third. Okay. Yeah. Usually in the evening time, right? Six? Yes. Yes. Mm-hmm. . That's good. Does that mean there's one session in October, or is this September the 30th, the October session? Uh, no, October should be October is one or even two. I can, um, it's because we, we, we felt the need to have an additional workshop that's just devoted to our platform.
-2.481855869293213;-18.21666717529297;6;Mm-hmm. . So maybe next week it'll be Eric that will be sharing a bit more about his work and to involve all of us into building of the platform. So we might. To have this as an additional to what we've planned before. Uh, but when, when we, when we get all the like confirmations from other speakers, we can, we will confirm it with you at the beginning of the next week, I guess. All righty. We have lovely weekends then. Enjoy your evenings. Thank you Mi. Bye everyone. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Have a great Thank you. Bye bye. Okay. Okay. I, I need to, uh, if you wanna chat.
-8.119681358337402;-12.60490608215332;5;Okay. Okay. Whatever. Oh my God. Are we doing it? No. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? I'm here. It's not happening. I don't know. No, no, no, no, no, no. Yes, I can, I can keep on speaking and we will at some point. Uh, we probably Exactly, exactly. Probably . If, where comes to where guys? If where comes to where Aada, we will, uh, all end up in in the pond. At the bottom of the pond. At the bottom of the pond. At the bottom of the pond. The bottom of the pond.Okay. Uh, is, is working now? Yes. Okay, great. Two more people.It's all good. It's all good? Yes. Yeah. Can we wait another 10 minutes or what can we do and wait another five minutes and then. I, and then I'm ready, and then I'm ready.
-9.006278991699219;-12.022027015686035;5;Hello? Maya. Maya. Could, can you hear, hear us fine? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I've managed to connect on the, uh, YouTube as well. Hello? Hello? Hello. I can hear we will be starting in just a couple of minutes. Okay. Sure. Bye bye, . Bye. We. So, No, everything. Hey guys. Hi everyone. for coming to to Santa the pond. There are actually some fish in the pond. Comfortable and technology.Call, call, call center. Call center. So the technical side of appears, we have a hydrophone, which is a type of microphone that can listen to underwater sounds being fed into my synthesizer. And over there there are series of granular engines, ULAR engine, the type of device which can listen to an incoming sound. And if you imagine a sound like a stream, This engine will divide the stream into different segments called grains, and these grains get rearranged and recomposed and deconstructed and reconstructed. So it listens to an incoming audio and it contextualizes it. So what you're hearing right now, it's the original sound of the pond, but it's transformed and mangled and processed in different ways.
-10.356392860412598;-10.926505088806152;5;So by interacting with the pond in different ways, whether it is throwing rocks inside, tapping the water, moving the microphone around, just interacting with it in different ways, it'll affect the behavior of the synthesizers. So it might take, it has a cumulative effect, so it might take a while for you to hear any difference, but this is why I invite you to pay very close attention to your movements and to. Just, yeah, pay attention on the way you're interacting with things and listen deeply, and you're able to hear the little subtle differences, which cannot change over time. And over there we have a contact mic, which is a type of microphone which listens to sounds of contact, like touch and per stuff. So if you, yeah, if you touch the leaf, you'll be able to use the leaf as a resonant surface. It is as a run music to run your hands around. Just feel free to interact it in different ways and observe. Oh yeah. Or you are, you can put it on your body if you want. Feel free to stick it on different surfaces.
0.3941000699996948;-16.653568267822266;5;Yeah. Nice. So, yeah, so there you go. That's the, that's pretty much the technical side of things. Um, so yeah, I guess interact with the surroundings and, and enjoy.Thank you. Mm-hmm. . Mm-hmm. I dunno if it's working. Is it work? I don't think it's.Yeah. Oh, there we go. Okay. Agency. The ability to choose and act was long understood as a property of human individuals seen as having a free will in this conception. Social structures such as gender, race, and class variously imposed constraints on individual agents shape their abilities and extend or amplify their powers simultaneously.
-27.38298225402832;10.547943115234375;5;Human agents continually regenerate and internalize social structures by performing them as they choose and act. Organizations and technologies, devices, systems, and infrastructures of all sorts can also limit, shape and or extend agents scope of choice and action.Working together, searching engines, recommender systems, social media, and a mirror of other algorithmic systems per pervading. Modern life. Presenting an agents with pre-structured choices. based on complex criteria of which those humans are at best, only partially aware and act to implement those choices on their behalf.
-27.93951416015625;14.544182777404785;5;Machine learning, neural networks, neither AI technologies present a form of hybrid agency in which the role of human is secondary to choices made by the systems acting on their own to find patterns. Machine learning detect features, aka variables from properties and parameters in data. By creating and dimensional matrixes of these features wherein maybe almost are literally large, they become sensitive to patterns that their human programmers may be entirely unable to recognize.
-28.21725845336914;14.896465301513672;5;Unlike more traditional computer programs, ness of the instrument of the instru sequences of instructions written by and understandable to human beings. Neural networks are trained by automatically adjusting iner weights of connections among hundreds of artificial neurons until they do well by recognizing the desired patterns, specialists can broadly categorized from elements in neural network activity, for example, as edge detectors in which rec recognition. However, even though it sits entirely a simple arisal operations addition, subtraction and multiplication, their algorithmic process, Remi remains mostly. In legible to human being, many AI system now generate their own new codes in order to achieve high level goals defining for them by human programmers.
-28.52431869506836;16.221471786499023;5;This code includes new sub goals and sometimes very, very even methods for achieving them. As they involve AI systems, they learn to independently create high level goals of their own at this writing. No AI system yet has fully independent agency. Outside of limited domain alarm at the prospect by AI system may require, may acquire fully the independent agency.Some computer centers are investigating such topics as AI designed to prevent them from acting a contrary human interest.Indigenous AI is an ongoing conversation among indigenous communities that approaches questions of the ethics and use of AI through indigenous perspectives. Jason Edward Lewis writes Indigenous Ways of Knowing Answers and Sovereign Territory. These extremely diverse landscapes and histories have influenced different communities and legacy street culture.
-29.177749633789062;16.395177841186523;5;Over time. A single indigenous perspective does not exist as epistemologies and motivated and shaped by the grounding of specific communities in particular territories, indigenous protocols, and artificial intelligence position pavement. There are many indigenous communities, community members, approaching AI from various perspectives, progressive issues of bias, industry language, coding, and concept. One of these groups is an indigenous protocol and artificial intelligence working group, developing new conceptual and practical approaches to building the next generation AI systems. Some of the questions posed in this working group include from an indigenous perspective. What should our relationship with AI be?
-29.007814407348633;15.834317207336426;5;How can indigenous epistemologies and ontologies contribute to the global conversation regarding society on ai? How do we broaden discussions regarding the role of technology in society beyond the largely cultural ho homogenous research labs culture? How do we imagine a future with ai? What contributes flourishing of all humans and non-humans? Because through indigenous ontologies, definitions of being that our relationships with the world are inactive and ethical ways, reducing harm to ourselves of communities and our environments, indigenous anthologies, epistemologies, and are rooted in context and places on developed in that place and the communities living in that place.Epistemology is respectfully interface with the non-human. Ultimately, our goal is that we as a species figure out how to treat these new non-human kin, artificial intelligence, respect, and slams creators, making kids with the machines.
-27.26590919494629;16.079862594604492;5;Otherness. Artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning, evol evolutionary computation, artificial life and neural networks develop logics and methods of their own close to the radical otherness of ai. Logic can be seen in, for example, Google's 2015 experiments with AI dreaming Engineers reverse the usual process of image recognition via new by a neural network to have a generate images, have a, uh, of its Sony. These images, sometimes beautiful, know is strange. Share neuronets interpreting horizons, towers, and pagos trees as buildings and leaves as birds and insects. Like people, they sometimes seem to seek meaning in meaningless things. Generating images of dogs. Pig snails came, birds and dog fishes from photographs of cloudy skies.
-26.93779182434082;11.262285232543945;5;An internet for recognizing dumbbells produced images of dumbbells. It's expected, but always with part of a human armor touched, no doubt because it's straining data, including many pictures of tam's. Use another evaluation. NeuroNet capable of recognizing, recognizing sheep. Also identified fields full of white rocks, but no sheep. Evolutionary computing uses the principles of mutation and selection to evolve pragmatic strategies for achieving predefining high level goals, aka fitness functions. Unlike real world evolution, however, these fitness functions are defined as quantitative metrics. As a result, evolving algorithms sometimes find creative ways to satisfy the metric.Not reflect the experimenter's actual quality goal. In one case, our, our research is fitness function included the goal of limited CPU usage. The evolutionary computing solution was to create programs that immediately slept and never woke up. Thus using C CPU cycles. Another program task with sorting lists, hope to simply delete the lists so that nothing remain unsolved.
6.0546746253967285;-17.405532836914062;5;That. May, may, Maya, maybe Maya's not there. Okay. Well I can just read a little bit. Um, Yeah, I can see Maya, but she's maybe not at the moment here. He's not. Okay. Shall we text, shall we send the email to Ramona with also little text? Maybe she can read it. We, you would like to hear from, from online guys if that's available. So whoever is online, they can just unmute and speak and we can hopefully hear you here by the box or Ram is in transit, so uh, maybe that's not going to happen just yet. Maybe we'll wait for Maya. So in Greek mythology, a chime, it's apic fractured female monster lion us with a separate road hat, then a snake for a tail. And in genetics a chime is similarly defined as an organ is whose desperate parts remained partially autonomous. The bodies of such living creatures are composed of cells from two or more distant genotype, the of the deep sea, which provides an elucidate example of exploring the ere qualities of the patchwork that primes em, body and reproduce by fusion with up to eight males attaching to one female as their host and Mel, their skin to form a single.
-27.886995315551758;16.8120059967041;5;The idea of artificial intelligence poses a fundamental conceptual challenge to any assumption of the singularity or supremacy of artistic experiments with AI can explore and advance this challenge through rethinking of creating agency beyond humanist boundaries. Speaking of how view agency Jim Bennett, concept of the agent assemblage is a useful tool for during developed on the basis OFS Anders. Discussion of assemblage invoking invokes groupings of diverse elements with unevent typographics that are not governed by any central head, but I've nevertheless able to function while the persistent energies that confirm them wrong with them.  While each we have a assemblage, a certain vital power, there also is a node activity, proper grouping. As such, agency of the assemblage in AI art context, this perspective can help to recognize the extent to which human artists. Entanged with computer hardware, software, algorithm, algorithm, and other tools, crafts and resources, including the knowledge of founding data sets or the subjectivities of data dataset labeling workers.The concept of the, in other words, offers a way to think AI beyond anthropomorphic framing and ai, ai beyond this singular, un unified artist, the individualized voice and their uniquely spirited creative ex expression. This also means that issues traditionally link humanized conceptions of agency, such as meaning making self-determination, auto expressive freedom, or the capacity from ownership, and no longer the. Inclusive coming of the human artist.
8.727459907531738;-19.677154541015625;5;Hey everyone, um, we are, we have someone online who is going to speak to us or actually speak to us, so can you hear us? Are you there? Pond? Hi. Hello? Hi. Hello? Hi. Hi. Can you hear us? I can hear you, yes. Amazing. Okay. Would you like your time again for us? Is this okay? Uh, or a fragment of it? Sorry. A or a fragment? Uh, just read as long as you feel like you would like to read. Okay. Cool. If you want to read one sentence, go for it. If you wanna read longer, perfect. To hear your voice. Okay. Um, there is an element of the unknown in intelligence, if only because of its generativity. Intelligence is able to understand something, it, something it has never seen, never heard or never felt, and even possibly do something new with it. Inte intelligence knows how to abstract from situations that that which it'll use on often. Heterogeneous states. What is, what is an engine that runs on the unknown. It is an engine whose energy is something that equals X of the reel and the heterologous without any given rules of convergence or synthesis.
4.8567214012146;-15.749507904052734;5;But a linear view of this operation is not enough. It's not enough to be intelligent to do something with data, nor is it enough to have a theory about facts rather than data. Suppose that intelligence can be understood as such. Thanks for joining us. Can you, can you hear me? Yes. Yes, I heard you . Okay. Amazing. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, everyone, maybe, um, maybe it's a nice moment to just take a break and just say how people are feeling, uh, how you feel about what doing and, um, what's your, yeah, what's your sort of sensation and impression about words and sounds, and then maybe later everyone can do something that they haven't done so far. 
4.242151737213135;3.8640389442443848;5;Wonderful. Hello? Hello. Yeah, there we go. Now it's working. It's wonderful. Well, anyhow, guys, that was a secret message. It's fine. I actually had one thought. I think because, um, because, because unproduced the whole session also with the fact that we, we are creating something that will have a visible trace. It's not just sound, but you want to create a video out of it. And it felt like a really collective creating. That's maybe why we kind of, uh, entered into the same space. Everyone was doing something different, but we knew that we are part of the same thing. And maybe, maybe this is all about it, to kind of treat livestream, treat disconnection with people who cannot be here, is the main thing. That this is something that we all create by being together. And we think of this something that will, that will become in the future out of it. But to be conscious to all the time, think about this collective. Output and I, I think it made, made a difference that it's not just about the activities we have here, but it's about turning it into one thing. One piece. Hmm.
26.314599990844727;-0.08315417170524597;5;I was thinking about the nature and the sort of technology hang out. We doing. Yeah. Yeah. I think there's, there's something like very, like frantic when you're in a club, you know what I mean? And I guess you do kind of get that, you do sort of get that in nature as well in a weird way, but it somehow feels more calming. Like I think it's, yeah, cuz you know, especially if you sort of like slow down for a sec and start digging through, like there's, there's a little frog jumping through there. We found like the, you know, the sort of suggy snail guy, like, there is all the, like the, the wind is moving the trees in a certain way and then when you move, you kind of impact the gravel around you and send that. in a different direction. Yeah. Yeah. It's like, you know, like when you're in a club, you sort of, you, you, you're in a flow, but then at the same time, you're also aware of how your movements affect others.
23.658689498901367;-4.716314315795898;5;Yeah. Like if you move too much in this direction, you're gonna smack someone. And you know, sometimes movements can be concurrent. Like all of a sudden, you know, you'll get that moment when you meet someone in the eye and then you both just start, yeah. Just start dancing together. But then at other moments you kind of will bump and it's almost like that sort of, here you're kind of bumping into things. You're flowing along with things. Yeah. Yeah. It makes me think about matter more and how you're sort of impacting the matter around you. Yeah. Movement and matter. Yeah. Yeah. One else. Oh, oh, doesn't matterhow this goes on , I'm actually gonna, um, what struck me was when I was reading was that I wasn't ever thinking about technology. It just felt like an extension of our body in a way because we were much more concerned with how these noises interacted with the natural environment. So it wasn't until I read it, I was like, oh, we're at, we are actually focusing on AI and technology in relation to nature.
28.37792205810547;-24.192707061767578;5;So that had all dissipated for me somehow. I dunno if anyone else felt that.Um, I, I also feel like, um, like the rating kind of put it, put the AI and technology together while, like when I was actually playing there, I, I wouldn't really think of technology. But then it's, it's very nice that we are already in the context that all technology are very accessible, provided and with her, like, um, the controller and the moderator and everything behind it. Like we can't ignore that it's there. But then for me, I'm kind of not aware of them and just like focusing on the play, like, kind of like remind me of like in the, as a kid in the playground where just playing our parents watching and uh, that's how I feel like maybe someone like of us standing aside and just watching this happening.Um, so that kind of like confidence of other, we're all playing, we're all here in a sense playing together and, uh, . Um, yeah, making me think of it like AI is maybe less of, um, like, um, about how to use technology, but just the kind of a way of approaching and doing and thinking things. Um, yeah.Fine. I feel like I have more rounds of this can be something like this over and over and over. Yeah. 
29.904191970825195;-24.528724670410156;5;Like here, Peter speaking. No, I think we, yeah, you were saying, um, uh, By I is like an approach. Yeah. Yeah. I'm, and, and because I, as before you even, you said that, um, I was thinking because this past week I was playing obsessively with the new generation of text two image stuff that is out all the, like the beta versions and the, there's loads of parallels with what, like how we were doing with those, because it's just like, you don't really know where, where you're going, but you know that you're gonna get something that you don't really expect. And, and similarly where there you have like a text prompt and then it comes out with insane images. Here the prompt is like touching something and you expect something to happen, but then it happens something completely different. Um, that doesn't, yeah. That surprises you. So maybe, yeah, this, uh, yeah, what I want say, yeah, there's a, like a, I dunno, I felt like a clear parallel bit maybe because I was doing ITAs the past, like 10 days.I was stuck in that world. But, um, it's very similar. It's, it's, I dunno is is a point where it's more an act of Yeah. Like, of playing and uh, even when I was trying to make images with those, it's like you get to um, more interesting places if you sort of abandon, um, I dunno, uh, preconceived images that you have in your head. And the same with he here, I guess. Yeah. If you stop maybe thinking of sound, it's just like a, I dunno, a tonal sound. I don't know. Uh, but rather just then more as like an act of plane it, you, you get to very interesting results as well. . Yeah, yeah, yeah. And because when, it is quite funny in those like beta versions of those, uh, softwares, it is like nowadays open to lots of people.
23.628690719604492;-5.818074703216553;5;You see other people there and it's quite, it's just like, uh, dunno, Nike shoes or something. I just wanna, but then there's some people that is like, like totally, you know, something that you wouldn't normally think of and that then it starts taking towards people towards like new directions. Um, and, but I think you only get to those places if you stop, if you start acting, if you start playing with it, rather than just, uh, wanting a result. I dunno where I'm going with this, but, sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. It's very similar. Yeah. The AI and like just like messing around and just like playing now. Yeah. The outside. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Which might be danger as well. I dunno. But yeah, I'll just keep wearing it. No. Yeah. The same. I want to take our next client pizza order. Yeah.Yeah. Is landing air first. It's a nice day long.  Oh my God Mm-hmm. Water. Water, water, water, water, water, water, water. Right.
-11.337381362915039;-23.650650024414062;5;Hi everyone. How is it going? I think we're going tear the volumes down a little bit and we can have a little again and settle down my song. Happening. Yeah. Slow down.Fish. Fish line on the. Laughing. I can, I can see the little joys of And stop it. Thank you. Thank you fish. Yeah, that's true. But this fish seems quite, it's a, it's a content fish. It's not a, it's not a traumatized fish. Happy fish. Joy fish. Yeah. So there is fish inside. There is free fish and goat. They all grow fish. One is, uh, way bigger than than the other two. And there is a, there is a war that's, there is a bit of a, sort of a power structure in the pond, which is one, the bigger one is slightly mean to the smaller ones. So, uh, this is something, uh, we have to think about, you know, or maybe they should be separated. I'm not sure. Um, yeah, so, but that's the situation in our ecosystem right now. No. So the fish is just in the inner crescent shape one. So this one, but I imagine they're, they may be slightly confused by us, so I think they're probably deep, deep in the bedrooms. The bedrooms of the fish, , um, yeah, obviously frogs and like variety of different, uh, life is happening, so we're trying to keep it not wild, relatively wild.
-11.336329460144043;-23.677379608154297;5;So, um, yeah. But actually the fish, I'm not sure how it happened that we have this fish because there was. Fish. And then I think, uh, for instance, what can happen that you can have a heroin. So we have a heroin that is coming to this pond, um, to sort of see if there is fish, but there was no fish. And then suddenly there was fish. And I actually read that heroin the one day sort of like go around different ponds and drink water and they can, and they sort of swallow the fish, uh, and they keep it in their, uh, in their fruit. And then they go to another sort of body of water and, and then they can spit it. So that's one of the ideas why after having zero fish, we have three fish. I think one fish was added by one by one person who, who lives in the, in the inner community. I think that's how it happened. But with the, with the, you, with the remaining too, I'm Notre, so it can be heroin or it can be a miracle of fish. Uh, so it's, it's rather complicated if you think about it. . Um, yeah.
29.600648880004883;-19.257301330566406;5;So how, how is everyone, how, how do you guys feel? I feel like we are doing like a therapy, but that's also fine if that's what we are doing. I feel, uh, we managed to exit the normal social context, our usual day-to-day reality, and then third into these little micro worlds, uh, that are surrounding the pond. It's, uh, it's been quite a dreamy. Hello, hello. Interesting as well being very much with the screen, like throughout the whole first half and then being able to actually engage with the sound devices is like, it's quite interesting how the screen-based technology and the sound technology functions in a very different way, and I still feel that the screen kind of somehow brings us back or like into the screen and you can't really engage with the, with the rest while sound actually amplifies the sensations. Um, and lets you even like, go deeper as opposed to kind of like creating this barrier. But that's really interesting for us to think about in, in the context of the projects as well. Cause I think we're still like researching for ways to like close that barrier between us and the screen or like what's behind the screen. But I feel like still it's not really happening. Maybe it won't happen
28.097352981567383;-22.913503646850586;5;Um, I feel like we reached this natural crescendo a bit like the last workshop where we really felt like we were working collectively where you're kind of, your ego kind of goes and you're totally in tune to each other. And we just naturally made this kind of shindo and then it kind of, and then it naturally fell apart is what it was all very intuitive and it, we worked together. Yeah. Think of like, um, kind of intuition in terms of making work of how we have our own intuition and how we are here. It's kind of like adding actual and actual layers of, um, like performative intuition to engage with different things. And, and um, and I, I also find that during it just like communicating with surface that is contact mic kind of where like the contact mic in a way of like, like connecting is kind of hysterical of sound.
27.60124969482422;-19.436466217041016;5;Um, that's very nice. But I don't know, thinking of like how to connect across the screen. Um, I wonder if there's like that kind of connection where you just aware awareness that there, there. Awareness, there's a screen or a camera. There's kind of a, another eye, like a third eye right here, which is helpful for me of thinking what I'm doing at times. Um, yeah. Sorry. I was wondering guys, how you felt about, about the text presence of the text and what the text did to you? Or it didn't, or it was in a way, or it was in a background or it gave some framework or like what, what happened? I don't know if anyone had any particular feelings about the presence of the text or the content or whatever.I found that I couldn't really focus much on what the text was actually saying, but I think always in these occasions, it's really nice to read together and to start voicing out because then you bring each other's voices into play, but also other people's voices, the, the thoughts that you're reading, even if you don't really comprehend them at that stage.
28.70648765563965;-19.44462013244629;5;I found it really nice to, to bring these ideas in. And then maybe like, sometimes you catch a word and that word makes you think about something else, and, and you might be like completely engrossed in the, I dunno, like the bubbles in the pond, but still like one word and it just sparks, um, like the inner conversation. Uh, the other, other elements is like more natural, even it's like amplified by the te knowledge, but like the other sound we were trying to make is more natural based or in instinct created. But text is something that requires you to have more conscious upon them. And the, I mean, cause other, other things we do is more like a human being, like as suspicious, but when there is texts, there is reading a kind of a very, is more, uh, more elements of child kind of distinguishes from other elements within the nature system. So that's my feeling about why text, why rating is there, uh, I had, I had this strange experience when I was, uh, I was on Zoom and trying to listen to this text. Um, it was really merge mixing with the sounds. And then I saw the transcript. We had the live transcript, transcript of Zoom. And when I was reading the text, I, I kind of understood it better. And then I realized that our eyes and the screen is more related to the cognition, to reasoning, to the conscious, to the conscious thought.
27.51315689086914;-24.370214462280273;5;And when we. Escape into the world of listening. Um, maybe even not audible, but when we there, we don't recognize every little, every little detail. It's more, it's a different kind of way of being, interacting with the, with the, uh, the environment. Um, so yeah, this is something about the screen, I think, um, thing recognizing and then yeah, like logical understanding. Like with the screen, I feel maybe it has to do with the fact that I work with video a lot, but like with the screen immediately there is, there is an idea of an intent, like, I know why I'm doing this. I look at things from an aesthetic position as well. So you are filming, like you're not filming, you're streaming, but like you're thinking about the outcome.And I think with the other activities that we've done, but that might be just personal, but um, you don't think about this. You're just like, you see, oh, what's gonna happen? You don't have this kind of like, preconceived idea and intention. Yeah. I have to say, because this is the first session that we had this idea that there will be an outcome out of everything what we do, I think it, it kind of helped, uh, for me to feel that this is a collective, um, happening collective creation.
30.33509063720703;-18.865785598754883;5;Cuz otherwise it is, it's, it's, it's about presence. It's about the moment here now, but, uh, maybe this aim kind of maybe directed, maybe this was this direction that everyone kind of straight away felt, felt the same. Felt, felt, uh, the feeling of. Maybe this motivation, this vision or kind of imagination also, uh, made, made us so productive today. I also, I was sort of like painting with the, with the text. I think what, for me at least was important. I, I think the voice is quite intimate and I feel like hearing other people, like of course we can all just like, read stuff at home and then talk about what you read and stuff like this, but I think it's, uh, quite different when you just like, sort of read for other people and people like really listen and you can, like, especially maybe, cuz I feel like I know majority of people here, like purely from like online experience. So there's like very basic but quite intimate and important things, such as hearing someone's voice and how they breathe and, you know, uh, or like whatever sort of fluctuations of the, of the tone and, and all this stuff I felt.
29.55791664123535;-24.48883628845215;5;Sorry, sorry to , but like, I just, uh, what to, what is to add to what you said? I think like, especially here, that we were all in this journey of experiencing this place to listen to each and every, uh, each, but like almost each of our voices that has a different intonation, different tone, different everything. It's like a, it's, it's, it's being taken on a different journey to an extent maybe. And like you, it may be even like in some slight differences, it changes the perception of your surrounding. Maybe that's it. Just an item of obsession. Um, Yeah, don't really know what, how. Um, for me, um, reading, I mean, I wasn't, um, couldn't focus on the things we were saying, but it was just like nice textural element. Um, and the way the text is written as implied poses and tones, so maybe it kind of transcended the meaning and just it was more like a yeah, like a textural layer.Compositional layer. Um, but I, I mean, it only made sense when I started reading mine, but even when I was reading mine, I couldn't relate. I forgot what I read. Yeah. But it sounded nice. Yeah, I think it was, yeah. For me it was more like sound element, like, Kinda sound a bit like water, doesn't it? Like, um, yeah. Hmm.
27.095413208007812;0.12081265449523926;5;Yeah, so it, it, it could be sleepiness and that's the reason why the language part of my brain is awful a little. But the rhythms there, like that part of my brain is still functioning and seems to be functioning almost better or the focus is better. So when the text, like when the texts would come in, It would be kind of like the, yeah, it's all like rhythm and intonation and then, you know, you sort of, I'd cue into like, oh, that's like, kind of weirdly hitting the blip blip, blip it tone. And you know, if I had like a stone, I might be like along with a voice, but it becomes sort of like, it was almost like the awareness sort of dropped below the area of, of sort of language and or linguistic linguistics and into this kind of thumping rhythm, plopping, popping sort of more environmental sound. Yeah. Lop is the , the is the written that, as you say, carries us fairly. We just, Tune into the rib and then we don't need, we don't need the linguistic brain. Carrie, with the rib. You as well.
28.36754035949707;-0.18667958676815033;5;I feel like we know each other in a very different way, or at least that's how I feel. That was like two hours ago. So that's just some, I mean, that's my impression that I've been very different, like understanding of each other and in the space. So I don't know if you guys read, um, the Butan Isolation. I'm the annihilation. I'm just drawing about it to everyone because I just read it and it's basically this, uh, it's about this, uh, like an area which is called Area X and it's some in America, whatever. It's like a sort of let's sci-fi paint where there is an area that is being like sort of overtaken by like vegetation and sort of nature and everything is like enormous. So, such as the sort of, the leaves are like absolutely ate and everything is like greener and. And like more like vibrant and, and whatever. And when people go to the area arts, they just sort of never come back or they sort of like become something different or like no one really knows what's happening to them. And then area arts is sort of expanding and expanding. Uh, and I dunno why, but I, for some sort of like moment when everyone was sort of doing something, I just felt like we just like reach like a different, um, that we are as sort of elsewhere, all together. Like a little, I dunno, not sort of, yeah, I dunno.
1.5907270908355713;-2.569735050201416;5;It felt a bit sort of trippy. Like we, we went together somewhere. Now we are. Yeah, now we are back. Uh, but also the root news is that there is a cafe very close to here and I think we can all grow together and have lunch and, uh, come back slowly. But the reality, of course you can, I mean you can wear your, your mic if you want to the cafe and just like continue the journey. Yeah, it's very good.
23.04530143737793;-3.803065299987793;10;How are you? I'm sorry just just start talking straightaway Oh good. Yes the feedback so you manage to actually find a corner well I'm not going to gonna wait for the equal questions I was just telling Rachel that energy because there's an show you're working you're taking mute ourselves Rachel, I'm envy your bookshelf behind I look great. It's kind of like a combines combined effort between me and my partner, but it's just, it's just a fragment of them. Like most of I think, like, at least like 75 80% of our library is still in Canada. It just comes over like that I bet all of them Yeah, yeah. Like eventually Yeah, good. It just sort of just kind of depends on what we're bringing over each time cool. I was gonna say your studio looks really cool. Is the storage now it's difficult I need to take I need to take like a long time to clean it. Yeah, yeah, every time I hear you Is it weird if I'm in the middle of leads it's amazing. It looks like the photo you shared with us into a different dimension keep it that's a shame Leah can't make it. She seemed excited about it and so tedious is going to be late as well but he is on his way back. From work I think I am I'm actually not sure how many people we were waiting for granted.
20.549537658691406;-6.810711860656738;10;You mean I'm wondering because I feel like someone else depends for sure. Or maybe two more people let me see. Definitely Natalia since she's coming. We'll make a couple more minutes. Ramona should be coming on my can't make it. Is it going to be possible for all of us to share screens in turns? Yeah, I can do that right. How was the last workshop? Was it really nice to be in Epping Forest? Yeah, it looked amazing. It looked like surreal. I can't believe I've actually not been to Epping Forest properly. I haven't. No, I actually have. Yeah. Yeah. Incredible. And Jeff, definitely going there when I'm in February in London. Yes, we can maybe do a group trip. Yeah. Do you have any feedback from dates? Yeah. Yes, it seems I got that. Okay. I'll do the announcement. I think but it seems that the 18th. Okay. It was a little bit difficult for us. Because, you know, there's all the time people like different. Yeah, we didn't have like an equal answer. But it seems that the 18 Plus more, it was better also, I think for us. Yeah. gives us more time as well. Yeah.
5.52933931350708;2.7798118591308594;10;Sweet. So I might book my trips. Yes, maybe give us like, two, three more days just to do it like 100% official. Because we have to meet again with eclectic is confirmed, but I think just to like, discuss the last details and then be solid, but I think it's the matter of like beginning of next week. Oh, sounds good. Say I didn't I missed the beginning. But I am one of the people that did not manage to find a clearance.
-3.049680709838867;-3.856287717819214;10;Yeah. Oh, like? I think I mean, we all have different theories about it. I spoke with Tanya today on the phone. And she she said that she remembers from September, seeing loads and loads of them. And apparently in London there was more than normally. Because of the draft. Yeah, yeah. And they produced more than usual because they the trees, they were going to die.
20.903173446655273;-1.826023817062378;10;But my theory is that because everything is so controlled here. And OLX propagate quite a lot. Yeah, I think the people the park attendance just like over them all as soon as possible. Yeah. It's really interesting to hear that in like Germany and France, people were able to find them and like, really? Yeah, it's interesting. There was a lot because I remember as well, I told Kenny, I remember stepping like going through the grass and alleys and just like stepping a little bit of acorns. But I think that was I don't know, like beginning of October. Right. Yeah. I mean, a lot of them. They might have fallen a bit early and a lot of them will fall in October. So now it's getting a little bit late. The ones I found recently as well. We're already sort of getting eaten up and I'm dying, degrading. But at So I managed to find some in London.
23.48277473449707;-1.2298074960708618;10;Yes, but this was earlier actually before the instruction I was seeing Queenswood and again a quite some. And I kept it because now I would I even ask Anna if it's a squirrel, so it's kind of it disappeared. Yeah. Yeah, it's strange because they might have hoovered them up or something because you, you'd probably still see a few at least, like degrading, even if they weren't like, solid, they would still sort of be around I guess. Or this group? Yes, we might have taken them as well and bury them somewhere. I've got a bit of a weird question, are they because that because I found I found this like map of, of the park near where I live in London. And they have this tree called like a like, I think it's like a turkey oak. Ah, sorry. Good, hot. So it had acorns, but it seems like it came from like, it would start with something that looks like this, and then the acorn would grow out of it. So I found like a few of these like turkey acorns were like the acorn hadn't quite emerged for some reason. Just a couple of them, like hanging on there. And they're seriously actually seeing that. Yeah, it's just like a chestnut.
21.005823135375977;-7.753535270690918;10;Yeah. But no, it was it was on a tree. It was on a map of kissel Park and it said Turkey oak, your Austrian Oak, they leave because the turkey and undertake take his tail. Yes, I hear. But it was weird because it would the images I saw it was sort of like it would start like this, but then it almost looked like the acorn came out of it. Now was it like a different? Yes, it's almost Australia. Oh, okay. Oh, wait. No, no. Okay, no, no. So he says it's called turkey. org. Or sorry. I was Miss reading. I was just looking it up. It's great to service secured or Austrian or sorry. It's native. Yeah, yeah. Europe and Asia Minor. Okay, we don't little I've never seen this. Yeah, the Latin denomination. Yeah, it's weird. Yeah. Wow.Yeah, they're really they're quite I think I think this is it mature. Something really odd. I'm looking at the map here. It's not very oh, maybe. Oh, no. Maybe it's this one. I think I think this is. Yeah, it's this one. Yeah. Yeah, it was an odd plant. Wow. Yeah. Just had these spirits. I hadn't smoking things. Yeah, it's an odd one. Should we? What do you guys think? Should we wait a little bit more? Or? I think we should start with it's already quarter past? 
15.352570533752441;-9.885955810546875;10;Yeah. Okay, cool. So. So basically, everyone hopefully managed to gather a little bit of recordings. So what I was going to do at first would be for us to basically share our walks and steps. So if it wouldn't be possible to sort of play back firstly, the videos and then the sounds that we recorded a speaking, or if you didn't actually record yourself with the sounds, you can also just say, yeah, just just mentioned something about that little bit of the walk in relation to the sound or to the smell, and yeah, to the to the texture. So did anyone manage to record the boss speaking, I actually tried to just log in at the moment to the eruptive corp.com/private. Was it three times enter? I didn't actually manage to write anything at this point was face. I think it's the one time space now. Yeah, I think Eric reduced the number of times you need to press space. Cool. Um, did anyone have any interesting feedback from the bot? Or? I didn't know how to log in actually. Okay, well, I know. Okay, Yeah. I had the, the one that we got last time, I think plus to go to hardware store. Okay, nice. Because apparently, if we all log into, yeah, irruptive quora.com/dash/private. Yeah, if you just press space once, then we can get the bot going. So if we do want to ask them any questions during this workshop we can. And apparently Eric just managed to figure out how to input pictures. So it can also give us feedback on on any images that we would like to check out so we can have that. Let me actually type Why aren't there any acorns in London in November? Oh, and apparently he he made the board a sort of professional oak specialist. So I gave him some instruction about how to be a specialist on Oak and temperate climate forests. So let's see, why aren't there any acorns in London, in November?
14.418121337890625;-10.374120712280273;10;There are a few reasons why there might not be any acorns in London in November. One possibility is that the oak trees in London are not of the right species to produce acorns. Another possibility is that the climate in London is not conducive to the growth of acorns. Finally, it is also possible that the soil in London is not suitable for the growth of acorns. I don't think that's it. But that's cool. But it's definitely evolved from last time, didn't it? In terms of feedback, it's pretty impressive. Okay, so um, since we're not so many, I think it'd be really nice to just go one by one and sort of share the path so I'm just gonna go with with the people on my screen, so you okay with sharing your screen Rachel and showing your recordings if you have any of the path that you took to get to the aprons? Rachel Okay, Rachel has frozen her image if you have any sort of videos of the of your walk, Oh, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Um, um, I gotta wait, you're on mute? Is it okay? If I speak like that? Can you? Isn't there too much noise around?
4.409262180328369;1.2492680549621582;10;No, no. And so unfortunately, I don't have any audio visual material, so they can tell you where these aprons come from. Unfortunately, they are a little bit dried. This was this was the time when acres were isn't too loud. Okay, these were this was still the time where when acres was around in there was low. The whole forest was in a consequence losing archway. And now I'm seeing some of them when the bit more was actually dismissed. Very nice. So I think I can still make the infusion with them. And for me, it was a totally so yeah, actually the fruits of my sonic journey that I did back then it was in it was last month I think last month or maybe in September. My friends came to my place and we took my Gong big heavy gong to the forest. And we just started to play and improvise in Insight among among the leaves. It was nice it was already quite a yellowy Otto Mooney and they have a special relationship with Greenwood. I feel like this the intensity and vibration in there is just different. 
15.464245796203613;2.165163993835449;10;There is the story that it is also an origin of modern witchcraft, witchcraft. It is a story that it was an old lake Pitt and so when the other bodies it you can actually see the dodo For the depots, and it's quite heavy. And so I don't know maybe also is the reason that there is a special energy around like we would, we would start playing the gong. And sadly, step by step, some literature will come closer and closer hiding behind trees. They didn't know what was going on. Because it's quite dark sound. And especially when heard in the forest, it's, it's really like a resonance of any, it resonates with others as well. And so that's slowly they would become a bit less shy and came around. And so there was like a little circle, that group of children and they bought it in listening to this forest, forest concert. And I would also use acorns to play I kind of treated this metal sheet as a drum in itself. I had to select one, and started to throw the acres into the this is like a 2028 inch metal sheet. And yeah, it would be really quite interesting to hear this resonance. Report it did you any of the residents on metal? No, I think no, uh, maybe we could try it out in February. Yes. Yes. My friend was recording I think. 
5.4053192138671875;-11.95618724822998;10;I think I am gonna do some cure ology through the files. And I think this yes, maybe it's record I'm going to ask tonight. Yes. And I can share it. Maybe we can have some kind of a sharing folder. For I'm going with all the documents, that'd be great. And I wanted to ask, I guess I can still make an infusion with these acorns. Because it's solid and dry. Can you show me again? Just a post I just opened. So this is. Does the forest look good? Yeah, for sure. Looks like enough that you can eat? Yeah. No, I didn't I could call coconuts you know if hair. Or they are some are pregnant or is this mean that open one I was really curious. Because the previous one they opened was actually mouldy. Yeah, it's mouldy. Can't really Yeah, go for the, maybe just check. Check each of the each of the insights and use the one you open that was mouldy inside did not look already mouldy outside or not. It was really dry outside. And then I could see mould inside. Okay. Oh, maybe I could actually see it from outside because there's one.
10.185728073120117;-7.007429599761963;10;There's some sort of, yeah, it's a little bit, there's some sort of decomposition, that's actually okay. And there's a lot of AI that also goes inside them, and it sort of eats them up. So it creates a sort of poop. And that's actually not bad for you. Yeah, and interestingly enough, so me and Rodrigo made the first infusions, and they were super creamy. Had some sort of, yeah, they had some sort of like oil to them on top. And we thought, like, it was quite amazing. And then we did another batch a few months later with some some acorns that we caught after that, and it didn't have that sort of creamy oily texture on top. And then we realised that the first patch was actually the ones that had been sort of opened by by the larvae that went in and so that was the library that was making that special texture so yeah, so it's still sort of edible larvae fat Tim maybe this was some proteins from rat larvae a lot of protein and fat Okay, great. And did you make any any recordings of YouTube video? Oh, it's on mute.
22.832536697387695;-4.835869789123535;10;Sorry, that hadn't hadn't having a code. I will try to transfer that file to my computer because in my on my phone, I had because I want the I want to somewhere near Kenwood House in Hamza here. And the forgings Candidate A 14 November as a rifle II. And as some recording of the acorn here is smell now like a bit earthy, it's not earthly. Very Earth. I don't really know how to do. I haven't I mean Mizo before it's not like Minnesota went bad. Or like something like rice I went bad. But I also has a kind of aricie dirt. Like, wet infused dirt kind of snow. Shower. Should I play some of the recordings from like? Yeah. Yeah, that'd be Yeah. So let me see. So in the beginning, there's so the first one is making a one minute recording every time a service change. I share my screen. Yeah, exactly. That we were just gonna, if we can all do the first sort of step together and then we Yeah, so we'll just go for the one minute recording. Yeah, yeah. So they were and it looks like this. Books are bagged over. Yeah. Okay. So a backdoor version of the here and start the walk.
23.70794677734375;0.9482176899909973;10;That's just me turning on the camera. So that's the first recording. I can't really see ahead kind of interesting. In the beginning, I was like, I can't find any acorn because last time I was there, I see so many them. That was like, I was talking to a tree and I was like, helped me to buy the a4. And it just and then I just kind of aimlessly walk the route and and I was actually led to a foreign trade that look very fascinating. And that's the reason I went there today there's moats around, right, but there's also a lot of just sort of high grass or is it quite forested, you would say, nice now forest, like it's like, people will do dog work. So it has like pathways. But that wasn't I wasn't a pathway. It was it's like on the Hill that you can look down toward into London to the east side. And but then it was very peaceful because it was, I think, because of the fog and not a lot of people around. And so that's the first recording of the thing. Here's another one of just working within the surface change from Levi LISI. One, two, quite a long surface. And it was interesting that it wasn't what it was just because of Volga is because it just doesn't change your temperature goes so cold. So there's small droplets in there. So it just kind of like is like a little bit become a giant humidifier. That kind of wetness.
21.137353897094727;-2.9933321475982666;10;Did you notice any difference in the soil consistency from the areas where there's fallen leaves in areas where there's not because it seems like this bit of soil is more compacted than the other one to this one? Doesn't seem to be so close to retreat? Yeah, I think this is like very long. I think most people they also people work on this more often. But also because I was away from the trees that the grass is like I remember before during summer I was looking at wide wind inland like grass and return yellows, the lack of water. And there's no knowing that irrigation so I don't really know like maybe last year in this area. It wasn't so bald. By bald Yeah. Yeah. So that's a second when the surface change. You know, oh, this is just how I discovered the tree, but I don't think you need that recording. It was a voice note after that one. Okay, cool, then we'll wait for the voice notes afterwards. So those are all your recordings right from the from the ground. Yeah, yeah, I think there's a last one there's another one. When I know this is sorry, the other one wasn't the one before I which was the eighth one. This one is a one actually come closer to the acorn the tree the last one was only I can only buy can result in more than work about and then this is the one that actually we're going to write. And you didn't find any acreages at all.
21.782861709594727;-6.811172962188721;10;I found from this, like, Yeah, from here. I found some the most of them are like this, like outer shell. It's just a shell of some of this. Cool. Okay, you did find them. The last was here. I of course, of course. Yeah. Yeah. And there's like, layer of algae kind of all. Yeah, we don't have enough to fill the jar. Right. I didn't get enough to feel the job. No, I think ideally, maybe I'm getting a smaller jar. No space.So there's not so much here. Yeah, that'd be ideal. Do you think is still possible? Because now they're having this kind of mucus in the jar from the acorn? No, I think yeah, it's possible and then just if they start fermenting just open them every so often, so it doesn't get too explosive. Yeah yeah, I also have some recording I don't know if that's for something later. Let's leave it let's leave it for a bit later. That's from the other questions right from the other. Yeah, like recording voice notes and those Okay, so um, yeah, do you have any floor recording Yes. Let me just share so I actually Wait Can you Well, yeah, but you can see on the the Finder window right? Yeah, I think this is the first one so I basically went to a park next to my home so the first recording is literally me at the doorstep. Did you find any green before we reach the Parkers at all? Sort of No. It's so it's it's a little bit of pavement and then you'll see there's a patch of greenery that I'm going to reach soon so you walked out the whole way? Yeah, yeah, it's really that was quick
15.511611938476562;-0.7078588008880615;10;Oh, but I went on to not only once actually, I don't think it was seeing Oliver but I think that's when like we oak trees but no plan and you managed to sit beneath an oak tree but there wasn't any it was really raining I don't know. Oh, that's a cool effect. Is that all oak leaves? There seems to be a bit of a mountain Yes. I think really play that's nice. Well that's quite a tricky one yeah I love the videos right Wow gets really interesting because from the leaves you can really notice what kind of oak tree it is there's quite a lot of varieties okay as well yeah and you have you have another one or was that the final?
22.035850524902344;-1.6082404851913452;10;Yeah I do but this is just because the other part of the park was just so green and with no leaves that I thought it's quite an interesting yeah How would you contrast and like how it changes within you know like maybe three minutes away yeah and it was this like kind of heal very very dumb like brain did you feel like the the soil was a similar consistency from the part where there were no leaves and leaves or did you Did you notice anything? Yeah, I think it was different I think here it was just so dumb that you could feel your feet would just fall into the ground there's other trees out there that maple. Yeah, it was also really interesting because in this park, Springfield Park Yeah, notice that all the oak trees were either at the borders of the park so like really close to this or the only other one that they found in the park was next to a tennis court. Okay. It was almost like they like I don't know being close to humans somehow. Yeah, it was probably a very specific decision then to surround just dogs and then so at the centre there are other types of trees right but no, yeah, like loads of different kinds.
16.851627349853516;-1.9405534267425537;10;Okay, cool. Sweet. And Ramona, you were in Germany right? The walk you back in London now? Yeah, I was actually back home which was lucky and I've got this really nice tree just where I go swimming. It's like five minutes from where I'm from. So it's this it's really old tree I don't know how long it's been me kind of I might have images it kind of gross down from when there's some concrete and then it goes I don't know if the roots go in the river if that's any good location I'm not sure I just see the video right now there's still quite a few acorns on the on the ground. You mean Yeah, I mean, you did it two weeks ago wasn't it? Yeah, um It is quite Yeah, there were quite a few but the thing is also they all fall in the waters I didn't take the ones from the water I mean, I should have checked actually the consistency but probably really soaked as well.
21.524311065673828;-5.718533515930176;10;Yeah. Can you see that? Uh huh wait. I don't know a way forward out sound so yeah, I'm just going out the house from my grandmother's place and there's some textures was really nice day quite a lot of stairs going on. And a lot of steps and. So it was quite close. Yeah. You're saying it just took you five minutes to walk? Yeah. Or maybe even shorter actually. I mean, now I free videos. Dollar minute is what's this bit this is sort of sidetrack of the media. And on the left is a field thing. I got a picture like this. Okay. Yeah, like this. And then you walk through some young like grass. Almost. I guess that's the leaves actually. And that's is that a park? Or is that just the sort of side area with? Oh, it's just this side area you see now that's the river. So there you can go swimming. It's like the Rhine. And then on the right side wedded to vittatus. The oak tree. Yeah. She's that nice. Is it oak doing this? Yeah, no. Yeah, yeah. Exactly. And yeah, I don't know if I'd have a picture. You see a bit in here? Yeah. They're amazing.
4.995271682739258;-9.979716300964355;10;To really hold on. Yeah. It's quite impressive how they're so close to the river. Yeah, wanted actually, if that's any good or bad? I mean, they seem to be happy enough, I guess. Yeah. What I would call on actually, to be able to survive that amount of water. I guess the roots won't be going straight into the water that could kind of just soaking. Yeah, maybe. Natalia? Hi. Sorry, I sorry, this is my friend Amy, who is here with me today. Actually, Amy is is artisanry to researchers in ecology. And she actually has some idea or theory about why there is a problem of acorns in London. At the moment.
4.699885368347168;-0.03712289407849312;10;Do you want to share your handing over to me? I mean, I'm not sure if it's from with equals in London, but a month or two ago I was in Hastings, and then I was in East Sussex. And in both locations, there was like a carpet of acorns just like crunching and do you think does Absolutely. That probably other people know more about this than me. But apparently, so 2020 was a mass tear, and which is when eggs produced huge amount of acorns. And then normally the year after is quite a low production. And it has a big impact on wildlife numbers, obviously the animals that that need those acorns live. But it's meant to be every three to five years, there's a mixture, but because the amount of acorns that have been produced this year, is a chance that this year will be classed as a master, which obviously is only two years later. So the whole kind of cycle is off potentially, maybe because of the hot, dry summer that we had. And then that will have a big impact on animal numbers over overtime. So that was my only insight. I don't know if that's interesting at all. But just yeah, the realisation that, like the cycles that have been in place for such a long time, are shifting and changing in ways that potentially aren't sustainable.
8.487844467163086;-5.75655460357666;10;What was the name of the year that you mentioned? Most? Mast M A S T. Oh, yeah. So I think a few different sort of nut producing trees will go through those sort of cycles where big production then lower and then building them big again. And I think one of the reasons why they do these sort of cycles of production or production is also to sort of control the populations that would eat there. So if they don't produce one year, then they don't feed so many sort of animals and there's like, then control and then the next year, they have an overabundance, so they can actually make sure that the acreages will grow. Yeah, they have some babies coming from it themselves. Yeah. Natalia. Okay, so, in terms of my journey, so I personally, because I was always working when it was daytime, so I didn't find any However, my colleague from work when she heard about this, this sort of Adrienne hunt, she said, Natalia, don't worry, there's so many agents where I live, I will find some for you.
27.84048080444336;-2.0123941898345947;10;And I'll send this would be a nice. So she, and then so she came back to the places where she saw the aprons and she and she messaged me, she's like, Oh my god, there are none. So she found this this little you know, the little sort of tops, cups, cups, so I just have basically like a collection of of empty, semi broken sort of Adrian cups. So that's what happens. She also did sort of, you know, she was like, oh, you know, I was really trying hard to find this Aikens for you. So I was like on the on the ground. Don't, you know sort of like moving around the leaves and just almost on my knees, she was kind of, you know, almost sort of dramatic. And then she was that and I looked at the tree and there were these two. What are the animals that eat a square rose looking at her? And she was like, well, maybe, you know, maybe they're trying to communicate that they actually have all the Adrian's but she was like, it was quite a sort of surreal experience to have them looking at her like, sort of continuously for quite a long, sort of periods of time. But she did make a video. It's an 11 seconds video. So I am going to share my screen or No, is this how I do it? So just on your computer, and I'm just being a bit stupid.
27.361820220947266;-1.994513750076294;10;You're saying she said, there's so many acronyms in her area, but she did she wear they're already acorns. And by the time she tried to get them, there were none. You think there were none this year? Well, no. She She basically said like two or three weeks ago, there were there were plenty because basically, she walked through. So she lives somewhere around Hammersmith area. So she sort of walked through the park to go to the, to the train. And she and she was like, oh, you know, there was so many. So and then she sort of sort of came back again. And she's like, now, now, you know, there is none so it it sort of felt like, you know, they were there but maybe season I don't know, it's maybe too late, some water or whatever. I mean, because because when I went now, like when I found them in the park, they're already degrading. She didn't find any. And there are two squirrels looking at her. It does actually really make me think that it's the London squirrels because there's so many, like, we don't actually have a lot of squeals here.
17.554182052612305;-9.659364700317383;10;Yeah. I mean, yeah, that's the thing that it's kind of felt like, you know, yeah, so they were definitely that and they were, you know, plenty. So, yeah, that's what happened. Okay, I will try to share the screen which I actually, why is it so difficult to say that it's okay. So I have to change my preferences to allow him to do that one sec. We have to join again, it seems that I have to leave the meeting and rejoin with my video. So I will do that. And maybe in the meantime, you can eat in this. Sorry for that. I'm Rachel. Rachel. Are you? Are you good to go? Should we go to Pietro? Should we do Petra? Petra, did you manage to make any videos of your walk? Oh, yeah. Did okay. So I think two parts because So when did I go? Today's Friday was last Sunday. I was at work, and I thought I was gonna Can you hear me? Yeah. Okay, that's good. on my lunch break, going to find some orcs there faster marks night Parker found some acorns. I found three, three, or they can but they're very skinny. They look very unhealthy. I went through loads of loads of trees, but most of the Aikens they're empty. They just like it looks like an acre and then you squish it and he's actually just air or it's just yeah. But I found three. Then I picked up picked one up must have been like, two months ago on my shelf, so I use that to like, I remember when I picked it up, but anyway, I was gonna say yeah, I did some videos, but I was a bit overwhelmed. And I forgot what I was supposed to do. So I just took a video of me under the under the oak trees questions, okay currents. And then then I remembered I mean, I then I check the rules. I mean the rules that were supposed to do. So I went and another work when did that go? Couple days ago. So I have another book. But I didn't find any. Any oak trees then. Alright, so the first Okay, I'll show one sec.
13.928109169006348;-10.825396537780762;10;Okay, can you see? Yeah, okay. Maybe a start. Okay. So me do pretend the last one in Hyde Park is demonstration kind of is actually not. Okay. So this is when I started sort of journey was very rainy. It's like I mean that I think it just stopped raining so it was but it was very wet you can see how did you get to Hyde Park did you have to take? So this this is not a nice park that's the thing is, this is close to my home. Okay, you're starting. So I'm mixing two places. This is an attempt to find an oak tree which was failed, but I still went around still at the journey. And then I did find an oak tree but the week before if that makes sense. I'm not sure but then you couldn't figure out where it was anymore? No, no, that was just too confusing my store. But anyway, this is the start. I think it's nearly finished. I think I'm getting to the forest a bit. This is in Walton store. Just some fear. That's it. Okay. And then the sebag Sorry, I think I found those a bit. Okay, that's it changes textures just just tend to the, with the bit. There is no box is just loss of, I don't know what three is to be honest.
20.874794006347656;-0.9682310819625854;10;But it's quite, it's a bit. It's quite hidden. And in is this tiny woodland. And within it this this sculpture, basically. And it's like, five wooden trunks, like unfold trees, and they're all standing in a circle and on top of them. They're like chimes and they make sound with the wind. Um, they really make sound they're supposed to. Yeah, looks like a lot of maple maple. Always. Yeah, the floor is like, you can see but it's not soil. It's just like, layers and layers of wood shavings. Right. Because it's quite managed. You think. So? Yeah, I think so. But it's doesn't grow any sort of once. There's loads of plastic. That's why I took a bit. There wasn't different texture, but I thought there was kind of part of the and then there was another texture, but it wasn't me walking, because it's quite small. So if I walk it would have ended so I just but this sort of this way it is I don't know what kind of Oh, dang it. I was a bed of seven. That night was definitely one there. Honestly, was miserable days. Yeah.
26.568029403686523;-3.9256551265716553;10;Yeah, there it is. Whatever, go here. Okay. So this is the VT nine park where I got confused. I don't know what I'm doing. I have forgot totally the instructions. Oh, no. Okay, there's something. I think Oh, yeah. I was looking for acres with my feet. Yeah, yeah. I think I found some. Because you can see, I think, as Christian, they're all empty. They're very depressing to look at it. The thing is, it's quite intense being in practice what's going on. So that kind of confused me. And they were this weird bits, which had to know they are they're like, mutated a currency. That looks a bit different from what we have here. There normally create these like bowls. Yeah, people think are sort of the female part. But it isn't, it's like sort of a mutualistic thing where they evolved to create these. So I don't know if those are what they are. But here we have the round. And it's sort of these tumours that create when they get a bite from an insect so they grow around the insect. What happens is the insect has evolved to sort of leave a negative side. And so it uses it as a sort of shell for the for the, for the ex, oh, no, when the insect is ready to leave, it just like pops through and also it sort of works as an incubator, and the
20.992191314697266;-8.360939979553223;10;Oh wow. So inside that maybe they some some insects. Yeah, might not. I think a different type of that looks a bit like that. I think that's it for me. Show this problem. Uh oh yeah okay that's it sorry for the lengthy introduction we have Rachel Satish he's sorry I apologise if I cut out again we have a breaker that's been tripping a lot so the it's been sort of turning off power to the living room and with the router so if I cut out it's it's just the electronics let me see not sure where am I looking for you okay sorry I'm just having a bit of trouble getting and Satish Are you are you able to also share some videos or I think I can sit next week if you want now do you want me to say yeah yeah, yeah, cool. Yeah. Do Rachel Cooley so let me second okay, that's so can you all see this. Can you see the video? Yeah, yeah, not Lehman's. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's good. Okay, I'm playing did you have to walk far was it just a walk? i It wasn't far it wasn't close. But the fragment is not long. Walked or did you take any transport?
15.124587059020996;0.3301871418952942;10;I cycled I cycle. Like a park? Yes. And as I'm arriving close to the oak tree the video cuts a bra. Because there is a guy that started as me from a distance. I don't know if you could hear that cue would hear him. So I turned around, and I shouldn't be there. So I stopped the video. And I felt it's quite I thought it was quite interesting. First of all, because of how man it's the places. So as I was filming, I didn't realise where I was going and just headed for this young oak tree. And then you know that there was because it's a very important kind of park, or memorial or something. There's plenty of the park staff around so he was like, and obviously I got distracted immediately. Sorry, I clicked the video. So I found this moment quite interesting. I don't think that anyone else had that experience. I thought that I could share it. And the fun. 
16.42233657836914;1.515372395515442;10;The other funny thing was I wanted to read but I didn't because of the guy. And then I felt I leave it there because it's quite organic is that if I raised close to the young oak tree, the floor was literally swept completely the forest floor because it's like within this like really, really quite austere garden. And I wanted to film this actually I thought this was interesting, but then I got interrupted and the story went on a bit more. So yeah. That was the obviously there were no acorns. There was nothing And it was like literally human human intervention alone which was quite interesting and I have another video that you asked Oh explain already with the changes in in the on the ground like different surfaces so from concrete things that and then Advil or I don't know like and then it's Dec and in the meantime it was also called it's it's like it was actually flat so that was because there was a there was a part in your instructions to also record the changes in the different yes so that was that was that yeah so I also have no please go ahead.
15.98265266418457;-9.321443557739258;10;I also noticed that in your first video there was a very slick cut between grass that looked very high maintenance and then just like a cut to the to the soil flowers basically so I think I just went on the flowers or something yeah so yeah, I also have some audio recordings for you so I'm gonna send them over. Yeah, if everyone could then maybe we can make a shared folder to me I gotten any so everyone put their recordings there Yeah, so just for this last round Rachel you managed to to find any videos so I wasn't I did some videos but unfortunately I have sort of both a laptop and a phone that are in the process of dying so I couldn't get them from the phone to the laptop but I did get some images if I can get. I'm sorry what is going on sorry Give me one second. Do you know what maybe if we're sharing audio later sorry I'm having this is also sort of a borrowed computers so maybe it might be easier if I just upload everything and then all right there yeah I apologise guys I'm just I'm having problems getting my screen here so I'm gonna Lea didn't I wasn't able to make it but I'm just going to share her sort of recordings getting to getting to the forest oh so here you can see my desktop right so that's the like everyone sort of starts with a lot of concrete means like it's very repetitive I know she lives in ponds but I'm not sure where this was that's great, actually.
11.558429718017578;-4.193124294281006;10;Then there's video number two here I am getting porcelain. Tiny there's always a bit of concrete with leaves on it before you actually get to the soil the leaves always get taken really far from that which would obviously know a lot of pipe far away from the actual if it wasn't for coverups? Cool, that's the and then I decided to also make a walk myself and I decided to do it in Porto because obviously in Lander I'm already in the oak forest so I decided to see how long it would sort of take me to get to my from my mother's house to a park. So I actually cycled there so that it was not too long to get to the park. So I'm just going to just kind of share a little bit sort of so this is sort of getting out of the house morning there's actually not quite a lot of I think it's actually a lot less than sports and this park I'm getting to is is one of the best I think it's one of the most forested ones and there's quite a lot of folks there so oops. So this is me on the bike and then getting there here it's already entering the park and you can see that the flow changes while these roads are sort of one lane that's nicer and they can already start seeing the leads around and and then it starts really getting covered with leads even before you get to the syrup that already catches this sort of organic matter building up and I think you can sort of see how the sound already changed quite a lot when I was in the streets with set sort of start hearing a lot of those there's a different division from The Walking area to the action area where the where the oak trees are. Um yeah.
12.251348495483398;-4.306293487548828;10;It's interesting because you you don't actually get a lot of grass. So it's mainly the the leaves just falling on the on the soil. So it's a lot more patchy. And there's also sort of different types of vegetation. There's different plants happening in some of the areas as well like that one for example. And also, there's a lot of pine needles. So it's not only oats like oats mix with a pint cheese that's a core coke and And then I was interested because a little bit further down I actually found mushrooms growing also on the soil and these as you see these little leaves there's like a bit of a mix the small ones are toward older so they're a lot smaller than the other oak leaves that you would find which you've seen before and they're sort of Laurel also growing nearby and I found this cut tree which has loads of mycelium growing on it so that's like a mould around that that of tree wants this last one well yeah more more much you know what's going on? Suppose trees that's when I that's what I got before we go on to sharing the sort of voice notes we don't actually need to share voice notes we can just share what we remember from them as well sort of the Yeah, the memories of that I was wondering if anyone actually had any voice recordings of the sounds from the environment where the oak trees were that we could sort of share we could also share it all together at once doesn't need to be individual if that feels better So did anyone make any recordings of the voice of sounds I know Leah did I could share hers.
16.34249496459961;-10.508009910583496;10;It surely is. You sharing now I can't hear if so can you kind of knew myself on mute I think you'd be able to do it in 30 minutes no. Is there a share audio as well as maybe if he do I think there might be different settings for sharing audio yeah audio settings. I guess it depends if you're a Windows maybe I might be able to just share the screen when and play whatever is on it. Ah right if I share screen okay yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Let's see that worth Yeah, no no we don't hear it no no I wonder why must be a setting somewhere yeah no Cheryl audio settings if you go all the settings Maybe is there like a little Cheryl you know says built in no. Okay, but if no one if no one makes sort of sound recordings maybe we will just we can just skip that part and go into the drill Have a seat. But I don't know I want to try because there's on my phone. I come up when you have the the recording the email. You can pull it from your phone maybe. Yeah, it's true. I see. I don't know if you can hear. So the first record is a corn Soundwalk I think you're just walking sound. 
12.782920837402344;-3.0732128620147705;10;Yeah, hear it either. That's me trying to nothing. No, no, he was nine years old. And we had a life yeah, okay. Well, we'll have to skip that. We I can just maybe share on the folders and then we can sort of your back later I was wondering how everyone felt about the texture of the soil. And if you did sort of if you did that exercise where you felt the texture of the soil underneath the oak and then when he went back home and he found another bit of soil that was different to that old soil and what was the sort of comparison in terms of textures when he felt it and humidity etc. Yeah, I gotta know. No. Sorry, I'm so unprepared. I don't have a recording of it. I know not not recordings, we're just gonna go as like sort of memory feedback for now. Okay, this is gonna be hard to share recordings I think actually, I haven't really intense memory of the soil. Like I said, I don't know if you've seen I just shared a photo I managed to find a photo from the work for the acorns. We we found that this beefsteak mushroom, this was such a chair essential experience. Also of the so because the mushroom grew, it was oak trees and it grew just underneath and then if the tree trunk, so it was kind of in between that it was on the tree but within the soil already. 
5.6068291664123535;1.420029878616333;10;And I don't know if you've ever seen a beefsteak mushroom, it's it doesn't look like a mushroom, you cut it and it looks like bacon. And it's really it has almost this pig skin on top. It's really soft and squishy. Then when when I started the trek to get it because we ate it in the end. But I had to dig in my my hands into the soil. And then it started to bleed. There was this red liquid flowing down from the mushroom, literally like blood. So it all got mixed up with so it was quite wet. And with this the liquid from the mushroom. It was so so. So sticky. And I remember that. I think for the next two days. I had black marks on my skin. It would stain it but it would leave the dark brownish black marks. very draining. How do we eat the mushroom? So we just write it on the pan. Okay, we had our we did it with TD and soysauce great aids. It was so delicate. And it did have had this fleshy fleshy texture. Yeah. It was so be like a drop piece of meat. I was digging so badly. So it was all messed up. I couldn't clean it was you had to When? When did you find it? So I think it was last month or maybe end of September?
19.298913955688477;-1.3488346338272095;10;Yeah, okay. So slightly earlier. Yes. No, I was I was just surprised that when I went to I mean, I wasn't surprised. Or maybe I was by shouldn't have then, you know, last week in like a new forest. There was like they were like No, no mushrooms, basically. So there were a couple of kinds of like not not sort of edible sort of more sort of like jelly sort of daily mushroom looking textures. But there was no mushrooms Yeah, exactly. It's quite nice and New Forest is quite populated. Hmm. I think like it's quite easy for people if there is people gathering to like also gather mushrooms. Yeah, I mean, it's that there is like signage just everywhere not to do that. This means nothing for people so that's why Why can't you gather the mushrooms or queens property of the same as this one's specifically about the mushrooms was just the general land. think there has like a sort of clause about mushrooms. I think it might be specifically about mushrooms. Yes. Yeah, it was.
24.19097328186035;-0.6719255447387695;10;You have to obtain like a special permit. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So we're always like he's another first time we went. And we found so many mushrooms and I didn't have a bag. Just filling like all the pockets and stuff. And then like if there were people passing going It's like things trying to find them just being paranoid but Yeah, crazy it's almost no I was just gonna say it's almost like you know how you used to was like poaching in the Queen's forest like punishable by death or something. It's almost like it's almost like they've just gone from like one protein source to another country in the forest and I can't get the munchies. Yeah, I mean, that's that's a good lead up to what I was going to speak a little later about much about acorns, which is pretty much yeah, similar stories of how to take away abundance from people and make them have nothing. I was also wondering agates it since we're, we're with you now, if you have any relationship to then any soil that was closer to your home, that was not sort of the forested land. And also in terms of smell, if you remember the smell from the sort of oak soil and then the other the other one actually, the there isn't much soil around me also, because they don't have access to garden so and so I, I encounter and I work with is in pots. 
12.597610473632812;0.6584640741348267;10;And I've been having real trouble with foxes digging up all the pots. So it's been Yes, very messy. But it is like most of the soil I have contact with his boss. It does not belong to the ground. It's just there in residence, residential areas. And I don't know if if it's, I think actually, maybe this is some kind of unconscious protection for our body to numb our sense of smell in a big city. Like we numb our sense of hearing, for example, spending all these moments in the underground when it's just unbearable. I've, I have a feeling being living in a big city, you name your senses. And you do need to go out away from the streets to really sense something. So I have to say that there is not much accent sensations that I experienced in my neighbourhood. So you didn't try to smell the soil from the back of it smell very strange. Because in the inner forest, it's so apparent. I think it's also the thing. Yeah, makes me think of this sweet pine smell. Yeah, I mean, no, I noticed like a fresh compost. So smase really nice. It smells very rich. Almost sweet. Are they? Yes, I don't. I don't have any specific tips memory of like soil from from my area?
11.930458068847656;0.6200288534164429;10;No. I mean, yeah, it's interesting to say that we numb down smells because I get that a lot when I'm in London. And then I come back to Porto. And when I'm on the main street, it's just smell so much of car exhaustion and pollution. And then after a one hour, it's like gone. I can't feel it anymore. Almost. It's quite amazing how your body just adapts and and gets used to smell as if the smell because it was becoming part of our body. And it was indistinguishable from like, myself and the other my inside outside. It becomes just one. muddy, it's ever dangerous, because then you don't recognise these toxic smells that actually had heard dust, you just become one of them.
3.273782968521118;-6.725872993469238;10;Yeah, it's just sort of in your body. I mean, I guess you never really know how your body would have been without them, right? Because you just have this life and you sort of feel the consequences of whatever comes into your body. So there's no sort of comparison what your body would be like without this in you, in a way and it just tries to adapt as much as possible. Yeah. I guess that's what you call cancer. Anyway, a lot of them. Oh, piatra any, any feedback from sort of? Yes. Sure. And possibly another one. Yeah. But the smell of just about the textures. I think we'll do both together it's it's easier to maybe the touch and then the smell as well.
14.87497615814209;-0.32626229524612427;10;Yeah, so the touch. So I've tried three different types actually, because the first time I park then to the other day, so they weren't nice, but the actual oak it was interesting, add a few, few layers. So the top layer will be sort of fresh leaves and then a bit underneath Murata leaves. And then you get to the soil and the acre and remainings and the actual choice quite wasn't very compact for quite light very, very wet. Even though it wasn't raining that day, but it's been raining for a while now. In London it's very black the soil he felt even though it was night Park which is quite central it felt there was quite a lot of stuff inside it even though they clean a court I think the three I found that a currency was squeezed on the side was near car park. So maybe people don't go there and maybe they'll clean it as much and then eat I'm not sure. And then the other two Oh, this oh, this mail. I can't remember. I had bark. No idea. There was so much going on. That they there's people at Napa yell there's people like blasting music but they cycle it was and is IRL anyway. Too many informations but when I went this week, so the software I took the videos. I as you can see it is quite artificial is not really so it's it feels so soft. It feels like walking on either. No, it's weird. It feels so hollow underneath. It just layers of this weird wood chippings.
18.531099319458008;0.24417565762996674;10;And that's closer to your house. Yeah. Yeah. And but then the weird thing is like I had the cause but just for the morning, I think I thought I had the proper coffee. Then he went by evenings, I couldn't smell basically nothing. It was a very, very faint smell of too bad. It's just a bit mouldy thing. It didn't. Because again, it's just wood cutting. So it's quite fresh material. It was very wet. Felt like, felt a bit like foods. You know, it's like very, very white wood. And it's, yeah, it's very fibrous. It feels like you could eat it.
19.73883056640625;0.38375744223594666;10;You feel like it was already rotting. So it had some mould on it or not. It didn't look like I could smell it. But just it just looked like food. It just looked like processed chicken or something. Strange. And then the one the one in my garden. That's different. Notice very compact. This is like solid. That one thing? Change. I think. I don't know why. It's just feel like someone with a show that either like in a break. It's probably very mineral and only bacterial doesn't probably have a lot of fungi. Yeah. Although lots of cats do the stuff around there is what is growing on the garden. What sort of plants it's a bit wild stage. Lots of weird trees. This this palm tree doesn't belong. It's grown so big. It's really big. Then some loads of rosemary, and loads of weeds that just taken over. It's quite varied. Quite a lot of roses. Okay, this weird one they desperately nice fans. Anyway, yes.
22.62655258178711;-0.10443069040775299;10;Cool. Thank you. So um, and yeah. In terms of like, sort of smells and, and touches. Yes. I mean, I think very similarly to Pietro. The soil was super, super wet and really black. That's something that I also noticed. And it wasn't compact at the top layer. It was kind of crumbly, it felt almost clay like so I had like little peace between my fingers and I could easily like roll it into a ball and it would keep keep shape. I was quite plastic. I And then I didn't really dig much deeper because it was so wet and already even from the top layer like my hands will get black but it did seem that to be much more compact and then when I came back home and we have this like strip of greenery just like two metres from the door the so seemed quite similar in in terms of texture. The smell smells a little bit different. I don't know like I think in the park it was more I don't know. Yeah, maybe maybe it was like for me I think I realised that maybe it's difficult to smell it because there's also a road and you have all the fumes and everything and exactly what you were talking about earlier is kind of like a numbs your senses. So in the park there was there was pressure and I think that was mostly the difference actually, like in my ability to perceive the smell. So yeah.
13.661375045776367;1.909597635269165;10;Cool, thank you. Ramona year round the tree, there wasn't really much kind of soil. So it was really hard to smell it actually. Um, they was really crumble, like porous. So it was at the smell wasn't really like intense, I can't really tell what it was like. I wonder also because there's like bushes growing around it. So maybe that's why they're sharing. And then back home was in my grandmother's garden. And at the moment there's not much growing she wasn't really taken care of. So I kind of I picked up some and was smelling in which was it was much more like moist kind of Yeah, humid, but then also got distracted. She had like a huge patch of like old sage. So I kind of see that as sniff that instead. That's nice. Cool. And so TD
17.795631408691406;1.5947009325027466;10;Yeah, quite. I'm quite similar with Ramona, I would say. Can you hear me? Yep. Yep, sorry, I have that. I don't know what's wrong with the connection. That's why I don't have the camera on. i You gon suddenly get stuck on above the router. Yeah, quite quite similar with Ramona also, perhaps for different reasons. I was in a very, as I said before mannerist natural setting. So I guess that played a part. But also, I, I encountered, of course, the intense wetness and the how clogged the soil was with all the different elements that fell from the trees, and now started to rot in because of that, so that was very interesting. But yeah, I would say that it was mostly sand less the soil where I was witnesses, which was quite interesting, but it smelled more like when you buy from the, from the flower soap to like some compost for your, for your houseplants or something like that. It smells more like that. So it was like a very familiar, not for the right reasons smell from like me doing pottery at home, and like, you know, rejuvenating sample samples. So yeah, that was the main observation a bit disappointing at this point for me. But now thinking about it, perhaps it was what it was.
20.65936279296875;0.17650431394577026;10;Yeah, yeah. No, it's interesting to have this sort of different experiences to be able to compare as well. So it's interesting to have your sort of very managed landscape experience. And thank you other me feedback. I think I remember similar to my room such as something that I feel like is very coursed, like coffee grounds when touching soil. And like the tree is quite close to the ground and branches so like how to crawl inside, like the leaves to to find a corner get to the bottom of the tree, and around the tree. The leaves are kind of feel like it's still fresh, like it's kind of rare because you The other trees around their their acorns are gone. But this was somehow probably because it's like, underneath the leaves and branches still there. And the soil was wet but not so wet compared to outside of the leafs. That kind of big umbrella. Okay, yeah, yeah. And it's now quite fresh. But also, even though if it's now fresh a few 30 Because it is a place where people go walk their dogs, and I think only dog go under the tree. No one else was actually not even kids. It was very low to the ground please. 
21.854228973388672;0.7685319781303406;10;Do you think it smelled like dog pee as well? No, it doesn't it but I feel like is there I just knowing because there's so many dogs around. If I need output from those docks. You can see so it's it's Yeah, I do feel like that when I'm in like the city urban parks have filled their D when, like when I see people said allerdings a tree. I sat there but as do I feel they're double. But if this is like in the forest even happening, it feels like I don't need that. Third doesn't really 30 doesn't really come. Yeah. Rachel really, really similar to ADA, the park that I went to is a lot of dogs. Like a lot of house host pets in the area. And it was also a fairly young oak tree. So also quite low the ground. And similarly, I kept, you know, in the back of my mind, I kept thinking about all the dogs that have inevitably peed on that tree. But also and I don't I don't know if it's because of the ground, or the soil, like the quality of the soil or if it was the fact that it was so cold, I couldn't really smell that much. And I mean, this the there's sort of the soil in this park differs, like there's areas where it is a bit more Sandy and lomi. But the particular part of the park I was in is I think there's a lot of clay, like it's almost like the colour of like, dark bitter chocolate, but it's super slick. Like and when it gets wet. 
23.013032913208008;0.742163360118866;10;You know, it's the kind of clay soil where you just have like, puddles inside the clay. Right? Like, yeah, like joggers, and it's and it was along a jogging path too. So it just sort of worn in. And also, I thinkthat happened near the oak tree or more towards the path, the part where people jog on it was kind of along the side next to the like the the jogging area kind of split around the oak tree there was sort of like a main trough that it was worn in but then there were little like side ones where you could tell people were trying to avoid the main pit but but underneath the tree, it was still kind of it still had that same like condense chocolate pudding. Almost texture to it, it was super, super slick. And then you just get like little bits of grass kind of coming out the grass that had been trampled and squished into it. And and I think also in a lot of the parts of the park I've seen them like being flagged fairly sorry, fairly thorough about cleaning up the leaves. So there wasn't like that. That's like as much of a smell of, you know, sweet decomposing reef litter that you get in the woods. Yeah. But then when I came back home which is like literally just across from the park. 
25.20966911315918;-0.9153024554252625;10;We have kind of like one of those overgrown front gardens with like, you know, someone pot pot, like plop like a palm tree in there at one point there's some Rosemarie there's a couple of like like geraniums, you know like it's it's a lot of I think a lot of it is just sort of houseplants that became overgrown and then over various generations people lived in the council flat sort of pop them down but there's a bit more like leaf mould and a bit a bit more like leaves and bits of stuff there so the ground actually had like a bit more of a scent it was sweeter yeah. Can I just ask the question to Sarah? Yeah, sure. So I was wondering whether Do you Do you have a particular interest in aprons? Or is it just kind of, for this exercise? I'm just curious whether it's something that typically, this part of the the exercise where we sort of described the soil and yeah, it's sort of very connected to, to eight grins and forested land, but I was going to let everyone just sort of describe that, and then I'm gonna go to the second part. Yeah, yeah. So, so yeah. 
11.685052871704102;-3.0811827182769775;10;Yeah, if you have any, any sort of sharings, about the kind of soil or the different soils between the near that the oak trees as well, if you want to share, and then and then we can go on to Leah as well, because she's now here with us. Unfortunately, I don't. So I will pass, of course, because it was your friend. Yes. Yeah, exactly. Helia. So we were just sort of sharing our experiences, because it's a little bit hard to share. Sound, it seems sound recordings. So we're just wondering about comparing the sort of textures that we felt and the smells that we felt from the sort of forested area or near where the oak tree was any memories from that. And then if you also have any memories from the other soil that was close to your house, if that if you also managed to do that a little bit.
13.771589279174805;1.0483825206756592;10;Yes, hello, everyone. Sorry, I'm in the streets. I just came out of that meeting. And I was like, Where do I sit? So I'm on the bench. But yeah, it was so sad because I really liked on Monday, I was like, Okay, I'm gonna do this full experience on my own and was really nice, because I just moved into this new era in the suburb of Paris, it was also a way for me to discover the era. So I googled places with octree. And I found this path that was only full of trees. And there was an acorn everywhere, which was really strange everywhere on the ground. So the soil over there, it's a path, so it's still very bad landscape around, although it's a stubble, but the soil was quite. It was really hard actually, to get it. It was hard soil. And I was thinking it would be very tender, but actually, I really struggled like quite dry. Like base compared to the one next to my house, which has, it's also quite outright based. I know that this f is in this era. It's very it's full of Agile. I don't like to say agile English, actually, I just how would you call it? Your clay? Clay? Clay Clay, exactly, sorry. 
16.052841186523438;0.08625076711177826;10;So the both both sides were quite similar because we are on clay based ground. But the other one had has an olive tree in my in the garden. And so I think it was a bit more tender, although it was raining. So when I started to touch the soil over there, it was really humid and really easy to grasps. And then because it started to rain a lot, I came in with the soil in my hand. And then as soon as I came in, it dried out. So I couldn't have the full experience of comparing both soil. But they were quite similar because I know that this is very much of a Clay Clay IRA in a way. That was quite Yeah, I mean, I had to really like push a cone. When I was sitting on the ground next to the oak tree like I had to push to access the ground, which was quite interesting, as if the acorn just took over the old place. And this was really interesting. This email also that was going around of people not being able to find any acorn in London and me having like, tonnes of fruits and nuts. Yeah. Not understanding because we are not that far away. So I don't know what I don't know. I guess you guys already discussed that. Yeah,
5.348543643951416;0.5430405735969543;10;I mean, it could be that it's sort of late in the day and they could have already decomposed in some areas if they went a bit. Or we were also thinking because there's a lot of squirrels in London possibility. We don't have so many squirrels here. Or that they might have been swept away in certain areas by like the gardeners. Okay. And it's interesting because I met while I was collecting incomes, I met a guy who was with this dog. And then he told me Oh, what are you doing? I was like, I'm just collecting a con and said No, don't do that. It's very poisonous. And he looked online because he told me that the vessel was very poisonous for his dog. And I didn't know that that's it's really bad for dog to eat a cone from the ground. And I was like, No, you can actually ferment them and making fish. And then he looked online. And he was like, Yeah, that's true. But he was really surprised that someone was actually collecting acorns. So maybe there is a thing or so that in France, no one collects acorns. So there's lots.
9.519659996032715;-6.481269836425781;10;Yeah, that's interesting. Because, yeah. Because obviously, like in Portugal, it's very unfortunate. In Spain, for example, it's very well known that you give aprons to pigs. And they sort of, it's actually the most expensive. It's actually eaten acorns and not been kept inside and just given sort of animals. So that's a very special type where they're actually let loose. Or they even so. Yeah, maybe I'll go into the second. Actually, no, I wanted to show you. Let me see now. Okay, I'll speak about this now. So So yeah, for example, in Portugal, when you speak to people about acorns, some of them sort of older generations, they would say, oh, yeah, remember when we do sort of a corn bread and things like that, but most people would just associated to pigs, and that pigs eat acorns, not humans. And so it's, it's sort of really interesting how that transition happened, which is a very cultural transition. And it feels like, it's just, you know, the idea of modernization and us eating different types of foods that are more sort of in the supermarkets, whatever. But if you sort of go back in history, you see that there's a very sort of premeditated turn towards not eating aprons. So you have, for example, in Portugal, the fascist regime of Salazar that came went up, it was 40 years, almost until 74. 
-5.477046489715576;-0.9478335976600647;10;And he would have the very, like, for example, the weak campaigns, they'd be very strong. So you'd have whole areas where there's just wheat, so like huge monocultural lands, with no trees whatsoever. And there's this famous book by says, I lemma Kostich, which is in Spanish, but also translated to Portuguese, which is called translated would be a manual of a Korean cooking for the posting for the post petroleum era. And so in there, he also speaks historically about how econ sort of entered a period of disuse. And he speaks also about the fascist regime of Franco, and how kids would then start being schooled. So there was like the official schooling system. And then the official schooling system, there'll be these manuals where it would be written down, what would be the sort of punishment given to children that would come to schools with acorns in their pockets, because they would come with them to be eaten. So they would, they would have it as food. And then they would be physically beaten up, beaten up or on the hand, or slapped or whatever. And they will be told that's not food for humans, that's not for civilised people, that's food for animals, and you're not an animal. 
7.3479180335998535;-4.290750503540039;10;And so they sort of take this culture away from people also from the sort of schooling system. And, and why this is relevant. It's because obviously, acorns fall from trees, and they're sort of this perennial plant, right, that's a tree that just sort of gives abundantly every year or every other year as we, as you notice. And acorns are very rich, so they have all the essential proteins. And they have a lot of carbohydrates as well. So they're actually in terms of essential proteins are actually quite balanced even more than a lot of annual greens. And so, there's, there's more or less a figure that if you have more, more or less 200 kilos, which is not that much, because me and Rodrigo actually gathered that last year, so it's like in big tanks. You could sort of feed a person for a whole year on an acre and based diet and you think, Okay, well, that's a lot because that's a lot of April eating but if you think about what we actually need a lot of wheat, a lot of corn, so we actually base our diets on a lot of the same staple crops. And for example, wheat is is more easy to store dry and It was used a lot to, like feed the military, and then to feed populations in cities, for example. 
8.838285446166992;-4.868184566497803;10;And what would happen, for example, when say, from the time of the Romans, when they would Congress city, there was like a big, big thing of like burning, burning the villages down, and also cutting, cutting the trees. So what you do is basically take the abundance that would naturally be there for people that would not actually have to work a lot. And they could sustain themselves from things that were just there, for example, so trees mainly. And as you cut them, and as he's like, Well, it's like the flash and burn technique of conquering land. When that land then is just in ashes, then that's also a way to, to make way for annual cultures. So then you implement annual cultures of grain of corn. And you sort of take away the abundance that was there all along, and you create a system where you need people to sort of be slaves to the land and to work the land and to kind of turn it over every year and plant every year and to just have this like serfdom sort of system and connection to the length. And to then have sort of a method where you, we pay them with money, for example, in order for them actually to buy food, because they don't have food anymore, because now you've destroyed all their abundance to make way for systems where they just sort of produce for someone else to then get that food. So that's sort of a little bit of like some histories of, of, of aprons, and why think acreages are so important. 
7.334416389465332;-1.3982130289077759;10;Obviously, if you think now that most of the land now is, is used for agriculture and monocultural systems, and it completely devastates whole forests, meaning that we now have this obviously problem with carbon dioxide and everything. And if we also went back to a system where we could live off forests and with forests, then you wouldn't have that problem at all. And you would be able to sustain all sorts of life, including non human life, and us with a lot less effort than we do now with systems that don't really work on a sort of global scale. And what I wanted to show you here is this, I just share my screen, I made soil analysis of two different types of soils. So what you can this is, um, this first I'm going to show you is from a project that I'm actually doing right now, where in Rodrigo lifted concrete, off a patio in Porto, and we got to the soil. 
10.000052452087402;-2.0030465126037598;10;And obviously, this has been under concrete for more than 100 years. So there's like no plants growing organic matter forming. So what you can see is a yeah, if you have a look here, it's very bare. So this sort of this is a microscopic sample of the soil that we found. And it's, it's just basically mineral if you see there's like very little, very little pieces of sand, silt and clay going on. And if you see like the dark brownish bits here, they're sort of small, organic matter agglomerates. And they're made by bacteria. But this is basically a soil that's mainly mineral and just has bacteria, which is like the very beginning of microscopic sort of life in the soil. This is bare soil. So if you smell it, it actually has very little smell. It's very sort of plain. And actually what I could smell when I was trying to smell the soil from this bit, which we just opened up the concrete, I can just smell cat pee, because they used to pee in the concrete. And obviously the pee doesn't go anywhere. So it just sort of stays on the concrete. 
10.333745002746582;-1.5789759159088135;10;So that's basically all I could smell. So ya could see from the sample that there's not much going on, and also have bacteria but this is a soil that's mainly bacteria. So that's what you'd call a very bare soil almost almost dirt. So there's not much going on in terms of soil life here. And then I wanted to compare that with an oak tree this is a cork oak from up north. This is another soil sample then that we did and this is yeah, so you can see here in terms of all these like sort of lines, these are fungal connection. This is like fungi. And you can see they have SEPTA so there's like all these little lines of connections, they're just they, they basically grow by like concentrating organic matter. And they obtained these from complex sugars from, from the plants, and basically from perennial plants. So if you think about, if you think about bacterium, let me just sort of go back to my screen here. Yeah. If we just sorry, there's a massive ambulance. Bacteria can eat very simple sugars. So if you have just a soil that can host, what you'd call weeds, so that they're very like the beginning of species of plants, they're the ones that can just access this very simplistic form of sugar. 
8.907535552978516;-1.569200873374939;10;And they can live with very like basic nutrients, so what the kind of bacteria can provide. And as they die, then you would form a bit of organic matter. And then they would sort of give way to more evolved plants to be able to support themselves there. So So at some point, you'd get sort of the annual plants and the things that we would normally eat. So pumpkins, and well, first, you'd have all the sort of rooms and other would have. Yeah, turnips, and things like that carrots, which can sort of go on very bare soil. So this is what you can host in very versatile. And this is thinking without applications of, of manure, for example, which are the external inputs that you need to put in soils are actually very bare and have no life. But if you have enough life in the soil, plants, including the things that we normally have animal vegetables can support themselves just with the life system that's in the soil, because that can actually mine the mineral silts and clays, and make them disposable to plants in the form of soluble nutrients. But if you don't have that life in the soil, then there's nothing that can mind those nutrients to give to plants. And so you would need to actually give them soluble nutrients in the form of external inputs such as manure, extra compost. And when you don't have that, then we Yeah, what is sort of in place right now in the global system is organic fertiliser. 
8.83841323852539;-1.1004995107650757;10;So you would somehow mine nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium from very deep underground, also destroying like very big bits of land, to then put in those external fertilisers to be able to sustain these plants. And they're also very high on an on salts, they're very selenia substances, so it's not also very good. And they also kill the life of the soil. So then you get a sort of vicious circle. So there's no life in the soil. And you're gonna get fertilisers, kill that life. And then the herbicides and pesticides also kill that life. And the only little plants that would appear at this point and very bare soil would be these sort of cold weeds. And so then you obviously input the herbicides to kill those weeds. But these weeds as you see, they wouldn't be present in very advanced soils like those forested land. So oak trees, you don't see these very, like, beginning sort of forms of life. Because yeah, so these, these very basic plants then give way to more evolved plants by way of dying and creating more nutrients available. So when you see this, I'm just gonna put again, that video. So a system like we have here, well, this would be a very evolved system where you have the fungi, that's actually the fungi, you're able to make these organic matters. So these big, black conglomerates that you see. 
7.979030132293701;-1.4474526643753052;10;And that's when you notice that the soil is really fluffy, and has a lot of humans that's humorous. It's actually made by bacteria, but mainly fungi. They're actually being able to create these pockets of very basically nutrients that are available there at the disposal of plants. And as you see these hyphae are these fungal connections. And these little like, dashes across the fungi are sceptres. Then they create these and they're made out of complex carbons, which they can they feed themselves on complex sugars that are actually li in the lending of, of trees, so they're actually in the sort of bark of trees. So only more complex systems are able to feed a very big fungal network because they need the sort of bark that's only available from trees and shrubs are not annual plants. Yeah, and that's sort of why when you get into very like millennial forests, you have a very big network of fungal connections that's being said by the organic matter, in the form of leaves, but also bark that's being able to feed all those fungal connections. And then you get systems where the fungi are actually, there specific fungi connected to specific trees. So they're actually income and communication. 
8.1162748336792;-2.0025086402893066;10;And they're actually able to mine the specific nutrients or being able to fetch water to someplace that where the tree needs, so the tree will actually communicate what it needs. And it's in a very close relationship to those fungal networks to actually be able to support it. And when I think it's interesting, as well as that these very, like complex systems that are forested systems are very developed one. So there's actually a lot of communication between the plants and the fungal networks and between life forms, when if you look at prepare, there's only the very basic plants that can survive. And there's no no complex forms of communication. So there's very little things happening. So you only get sort of bacteria, and there's no protozoa, there's no nematodes, that would, should be able to feed on the bacteria to get more nutrients going in this flux of life. And these would be very sort of basic systems, if you compare it to a sort of human systems where instead of abundance, we've we have scarcity, so we have very little food available, there's no sort of communication and cooperation, and it's just whoever is able to live with dies dies. So said, I think it's like sort of an interesting analogy, analogy as well to these very more complex systems are able to create communication and sort of sharing nutrients between between species. 
9.43142032623291;-3.661451816558838;10;Yeah, and that's, that's what I wanted to share in terms of wild forests are sort of important. Yeah, and also the smell, I felt like, if you smell a very forested land, maybe some of you even felt it, it's, um, it smells actually very fungus almost smells like mushroom. So sort of some smell, but trauma, which is very specific. So it's only from the smell, you can already sense that there is a very big network of fungal connections going on. So there's a lot of life in that soil, which compared to very basic mineral soils, you wouldn't smell that at all. So it's like a very different sort of smell, which may be now if you're a bit more aware of that, you might be able to sort of compare between them. And, and sort of these were the the aprons that I found, they were really actually been eaten up a little bit. But this is sort of a card that we have, and there was also some already germinating, which is quite nice. So this is stolen. If you pick a lot of these up and actually fermented in water, when they're already germinating, this creates the mob that's, that is able then to make actually very good beers. So with that water from the fermentation, you can actually make beer a corn beer, which is quite exciting. Yay. That, excuse me, so can we actually plant him?
14.080162048339844;-8.062857627868652;10;Yeah, so these ones are actually ready to be planted. Yeah, they're already do you think? How much time does it take for it to sprout? This is sprouting. This is fun. Oh, you mean the other ones? Yeah. How much time does it take for seeds to sprout? I mean, it depends on the right now. I think they would sprout I mean, I think in weeks because they have the sort of right environment temperature. If you put them in sort of a forest soil, it's more likely that they would start so there's a lot of them sprouting right now. Maybe we can also try that. Yeah, yeah, that could also be nice. Yeah, and sort of okay, so there's different types of oaks. There's ones which are actually yeah, so let me just show you here. So these ones which are theirs Different types of workers. So Quakers would be the Latin name for Oak. And then there's a different ending. So this is the Quakers harboured in Portuguese called overing. And these ones have a lot of tannin, that's why they're very bitter. 
5.668776035308838;-8.926736831665039;10;So you can't really eat them raw, or it's not very nice to eat them raw, because it's very, yeah, really, really been. And that's why we would put them in water. So as we put them in water, and we close it, that would start the fermentation process. So so the 10 would actually get dissolved in the water, and it would sort of be eaten by a type of bacteria that then would, yeah, take away the bitterness. And so the minimum amount of time that you would be able to leave them in water for a bit, two months. But it's actually a really good method of just maintaining them. So you could because that water would also then preserve it because the water then has all those tenants. So you'd be able to leave them in water closed up for like a year if you wanted to. And then just take them out, and actually then make flour from them. I'm going to show you a little video of of acorns in fermented water. So you can sort of see how they how they would. Yeah, so. So if you open up the bottle, see how they create all this guest acorn view? Yeah.
10.316842079162598;-8.368829727172852;10;So um, yeah, so if you have a very sort of close container that closes with a sort of lid, and it's in a glass jar, you would want to sort of open it every day, every other day, just very slowly take that fish off, so it doesn't actually burst. But if you have a sort of lid that closes like that with a with a sort of metal cap, that's okay, because the air can sort of get out very, very softly. So you don't need to constantly open it. So should it be airtight because mine is not that tight. Tight, it's okay to just let it so it's okay even if some error comes up, like it's not tight. But it's, it's good because if it's too tight and you have a glass jar, it might burst a glass jar, okay? So, if you open to take that out, then it sort of accelerates the process of of deep tantalising that of the ox so if you want to accelerate the process everyday you sort of open it let the gas out and close it back again. Um, I wanted to sort of share a video but I'm not sure I'm going to be able to share the sound which would be sort of the process of yeah, let me let me see if I can put the sound if we have a few more minutes because I know we started a little bit late so Okay, sound flower don't know if you're playing Star Wars, we can't hear anything.

9.919520378112793;-9.281195640563965;10;Okay Hello, can you hear me? Um, were you able to hear the first one? You were right. Yeah, we're not this one. Um, what I could do would just be to like, share this video as a yes, I could share this video on an email. So everyone could sort of watch it at the end. Maybe that's easier. And yeah, the voice recording I sent last was a little bit of the sounds you can hear from the whole process of sort of getting the acorn to an infusion. Um, but I could sort of repeat a little bit of of the process. So basically, you would want them to have it fermenting for at least two months if it's not a sort of, if it's the type where it's a pork, for example. Those aprons are actually quite edible just as you eat them. You can almost eat them raw as a chestnut but most most of them and the from the ones I saw that you guys had on the ground from sort of leaves. I think most of them are quite bitter. I don't know if anyone has tried but you might want to Yeah. Does that feel like not too bad. Cool. Is it? Yeah, not too bitter. That That looks good. That bitter? That horrible. We can't hear you out if you want to.
23.152565002441406;-2.9518725872039795;10;is quite bitter, but I also have codes that don't taste much. You definitely want to Yes, yeah. In China, who would have this to dry and use a powder to make something like acorn powerful? Ah, right. Yeah. It's very good. It has a name, doesn't it? Yeah, it's like kind of, like similar if you had how often or a rice noodles, like, boiled. And like, if it touches like jelly going like that. I think I know I forgot the name. I knew the name. Well. What do you call it? In Chinese? Sounds? Okay, that wasn't the name. Okay. Yeah. I think they have it in Korea as well. And they have another? Yeah. Nice. Yeah. So in China, you actually eat acorns, or just for that specific meal, just for that. That's like a cold dish. And there are Chinese like, company who developing a current liquor, which is very rare, it's like old processor would.
5.887524127960205;-8.742266654968262;10;Yeah. So yeah, anyway, so yeah, most of them are actually quite bitter. So you'd have to leave them for at least two months. Or you could sort of leave them drying out for a longer period of time. If they're really dried out, they also sort of eventually lose their bitterness. But this is a process of maintaining them. And also getting rid of the bitterness. And then you can also use the water. And so it Sarah, sorry, it means two months of like opening and closing the lids. Yeah, I mean, it sounds like the process, you would open and close the lid, I think if it's just closed two months is also okay, but it might be more bitter than if you leave it for longer. But for example, if you use it as flour, it's probably okay in bread for but if you want to make the acorn infusion, it might still have a bit of more bitterness. But so basically, after you leave it in water, what you want to do is either leave them to dry taking them out of water, or you can put them in the oven with a very little temperature for 7030 degrees. 
7.356671333312988;-8.510334968566895;10;So it just sort of takes the moisture away. And after that, if you can see that they'll open up, they'll crack open quite easily. So you'll take the skin out. And then you would need sort of, we have a manual mill, actually to one that like cracks them into smaller bits, and then one which actually makes them into the flour. So it would have sort of like a stone mill so grinds them into flour. But you can also if you have, my mum has a bit, you know the machine where you can grind stuff. So you can also grind it there. And and then you should if you sort of mill it, it's a very fine powder, you can also grind it in other ways that you'd have to grind things. That's that's the flour, that's already the flour for you. But if you want to make it into an infusion, what you would do is sort of roasted on a pan. And that would make it darker sort of more caramelised in a way. And so then you would get the infusion. And the infusion would would work for example, as a tea so you'd boil water, and then maybe on a on a cup full just put like a spoonful of the infusion, and then just put the hot water over it. 
8.453018188476562;-8.387375831604004;10;Or to get more of the flavour out, you could sort of get the water boiling and for for the acorn infusion in the in the pan and leave it for a few minutes to simmer, basically. And then you can get the infusion that way. And then if you slip it into a cup, and you get the little bit at the end, just infusion you could also use that then to put in bread as as a sort of flour or for example to make pancakes and things like that, which is also quite nice. So that is a sort of method. So it's not hard at all. It's just so so having this sort of equipment, so you can grind and apron, you can cut it into little bits and then sort of the grinding process to get there. And but yeah, I would also share with you the video that actually documents in Landreth sort of the process of us getting into the infusion. Well, yeah, does anyone have sort of any questions after my big rant? So you don't get to use the liquids much? I thought the infusion some somehow I thought this was the thing we were going to boil it drink. Yeah, no. liquids. Yeah, that's just the liquids. Take the bitterness away. Okay. Yeah, as I said you could make it in is a beer with a bit of specialty because you would, for beer because of the mouth, you would use germinating mostly at least half germinating a pen so that it gets quite specific. And then you need to like, keep it in specific, sort of be quite careful for us, it turns a bit wrong. When it becomes flour does it have like a quite natural taste, I wouldn't imagine. 
6.555603981018066;-7.197485446929932;10;But maybe that it's very, very rich when sort of people say, I mean, there's some places that say they make bread here in Portugal, but probably like 10 or 20% of a corn, which is very, very little. The Acorn bread that we make uses around 80%. Sometimes 90%, you can imagine isn't like it's very, quite dense and very dark. You can't really do 100% Because it'll just become very solid, because the acreage doesn't actually rise as other cereals do, so it doesn't become very fluffy. So you want to use that 10 or 20%, just with wheat or barley. Or if you have the sort of sour dough, if that sour dough is made out of another cereal, then you can just use a salad or the rest as just a corn flour. And that will give it the little rice. So you could play with like proportions, you could do less acorn, but it's very, very rich flavour. And if you make the sourdough stay overnight, or even like 12 or 24 hours, then you start getting that like sourdough bitterness, which I don't know remember how you feel. But I think Germans appreciate the bitter bread a lot. But other Yeah, other cultures don't anymore because they're now used to French. No, not the French flower these days, so yeah, that yeah, I'd be interested to see how you find that April, right. Actually, it's an acquired taste, I would say yeah. 
6.492156028747559;-7.810041904449463;10;But once you get it, I think yeah, you also feel like it's very rich, you know, like you eat it and you feel very satisfied, because it sort of really nourishes you. It's quite a dense thing. Yeah. So yeah, so by sort of proposal would be to when we meet, everyone meets in February, to actually be able to put all these aprons together. And hopefully I could bring the mill to London in my suitcase. And in the in the event, we could actually make the flour or make the infusion and drink it all together. There's a few aliens around, but I hope they'll bring plenty so we can actually they can actually drink it properly. And not just have a tiny sample. But I mean, it's actually quite surprising how much how many little kids you need to make. Yeah, infusion ritual example. It smells very nice as well. It's very surprising how little you need to make flour because it becomes very sparse and fluffy. So you need less aprons to make. I'll show you here. Yeah.
9.01806640625;-8.074226379394531;10;So this is sort of let me take Fiat video setting. Your okay. Yeah. So this is already a corn. This is fermented. And this would be the flower. Yeah. And then if you roasted on a pan, then that will become an infusion. And it become a little bit darker than this. Yeah. So this has like sort of a fermented smell. But already, it becomes quite sweet. And it has sort of, especially when you roast it a little bit more. Some people say it's sort of smells like chocolate or caramel. And a little bit like spices as well. So it's a mix. So I think it's very good for Christmas. And hopefully in February because it's still sort of winter. I think it'd be nice. Yeah. When when you see places selling like acorn coffee, is that then what it is? Is it just the the corn that's been sort of roasted about?
5.408329010009766;-6.412476062774658;10;Yeah, exactly. In the beginning, we would call it a corn coffee, but it's sort of misleading because it's essentially not coffee, because coffee is you know, a thing. And also it doesn't have any caffeine so it doesn't sort of, I mean, it's a coffee substitute, especially if you don't want caffeine but if you're into your coffee Because of that hit, it doesn't quite have the hit. But it's sort of very, very nourishing as well. So yeah, it's good for people that contain caffeine. It's like your tricks your brain, I guess a little bit. But we also realise that you don't want to sort of say to people that it's a cold coffee because then people drink it already with the idea that's gonna taste like coffee, and then it's very different. And some people get a bit disappointed, because it's not coffee at all. So you just have to go for it for the, for what it is. It's quite rich, it sort of tastes quite protein as well. Yeah, it can really taste the protein. It's it's Yeah. Quite quite specific.
19.86840057373047;-6.263280868530273;10;I'm not sure we've had chicory coffee before actually. I wouldn't be able to see. But probably no, I type. Yeah, yeah. That'd be nice. I remember. I think that is quite nice. But I It doesn't taste like coffee, but kinda looks like Yes. This is kind of a similar. Yeah. Is the coffee for children, isn't it? We used to have it in kindergarten. Really? I think. In Italy, I think they used to I think I told my dad I would, because there was a bit where I was in particular. My dad told me there is my grandpa used to drink and during war when there was no coffee to drink, chico? Yes, it was very much a wild ring. Yeah. But now they mix it with lots of milk powder, and I think I think yeah, maybe not sure. Nice. You, you got your aprons in France, you're going to be able to bring them to London. I can definitely. I can even go and collect more of if if we need more. Yeah, definitely. And bring it. And have you put them in some sort of container? Yeah. Yes, yes, they are there. And I was away this week. So I asked my partner, please do open it every day. And you know, he's very not into this kind of thing. And so he was really fascinated by having to open the thing every day to have this small, little ritual. It's, it's more like a thing that pops, but it's similar to it has a thing that steals as well. But you just have to put it like this. So yeah, but also I really wanted to get into fermentation. So that's the first try. But that's completely the first of many.
10.717938423156738;3.329444646835327;10;Yeah. Cool. Yeah, any other sort of questions? Think about common Joe, just thank you. It makes me very excited of thinking, alternatively, of where to use a very beginning like that. And I know you're talking about the mushroom that you can't like, it's Krings mushroom. Like the acorn. They've just fell. But like, there's no way really collection though. It's becoming not that it's, it's a waste, but knowing that you can make something because before I was trying to find the flower, the acorn flower, because I do want to make that oval that I had in China, but it's difficult. It's very pricey as well. So I'm very excited. We're like.
10.125786781311035;-5.935241222381592;10;Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry, we couldn't do this two months ago. And London is full of acorns, it sort of sucks that we're just past the period. But I think that's also the exciting thing. When you realise the possibilities. You're like, no, where am I aprons, taking them off. And so and so hopefully next year, when you see them starting to fall, you can sort of gather them a little bit. I mean, the first time that we got to the land, we didn't actually realise acorns were edible. And we sort of next to the roadside, there was all these oaks and the acres were just falling and cars would just like be making flower out of them continuously and no one would do anything with it. And if you think that can sort of substitute your main diet is sort of amazing what you can do with it. Yeah, one of the questions I had in my sort of instructions was that if you think you could live out of a place like that of a forested land, and I also found that because obviously in Landrover, you already have we already identify a lot of the edible plant species around and you have the oaks and the chestnuts and so and the mushrooms, so there's like a sort of big food source but in this park and for to where I went to it was also interesting because there was also a few edible plants that I found, and also other other trees that gave sort of edible berries or a couple of chestnuts. 
10.909215927124023;-6.113572597503662;10;So it's interesting to sort of start looking at these spaces and seeing what else can kind of grow with them or alongside them, that can be edible. And to think that if we sort of implemented more species companion species to be around, and maybe not underneath yolks, because they do occupy space, and they have, as I said, this sort of very specific, also fungal connections, and then don't actually allow other more sort of beginner species to grow in that sort of advanced environment, but in the idea of, of an agro forest, if you think about agroforestry systems, is that in terms of volume, they're a lot more dense than a sort of annual monoculture. Because, yeah, you're not just thinking about a straight line, you're thinking about all the things that can grow in a sort of, in canopy, that kind of layer, so you'd get the sort of big trees and the shrubs, and then the sort of animal plants would go round the. So they wouldn't unnecessarily go underneath the trees, but they would go in the surrounding area between trees. So you get this sort of niches, niches and pockets of where different species can, can meet or live together. And sort of, yeah, I wanted to leave you a little bit with that and about with the idea of, of where you went to the nifty oaks and to think about also what other species were there, or could be there in companionship, and could sort of be able to nurture us the whole year round. And yeah, I don't know if anyone has any thoughts on that, or if they saw if they felt if there was a sort of environment that you could envision being that you could live out of as a food source.
5.127108097076416;-2.6069016456604004;10;Because that's sort of how our ancestors and also hunter gatherers foragers lived like before agriculture and they actually they knew how to identify more than 1000 Different species or the environment so so they actually a lot more different food sources than we do nowadays, which is quite interesting. Yeah.
7.382580280303955;1.1677584648132324;10;So which plants do you know exactly which plants grow around oak trees? Like you have ISIS most Pasha lamb is not trying to plumb but I couldn't identify anything else really, because I thought maybe some digitally have some like first gloves or things like that, but I couldn't do any of that.
11.607504844665527;-5.743346691131592;10;I think so maybe not. So in a sort of agroforestry system, you couldn't necessarily have a super dense canopy evokes you'd have to have sort of more sparse so then the in between them you could grow other things. But there's sort of various types of shrubs for example that you could grow so like more perennial plants and just then within the sort of limits of the Oaks you can then see other sorts of plants so yeah, I would probably know more names in Portuguese by this point than an English but but I can also share with you and the website where there's like the edible section so you can see the sort of different different plants that we have and then unnecessarily like super close to the oak trees, but they're sort of around and sort of forest area. So yeah, but even in this park I don't know if I have a sort of video but yeah, I think I showed a little bit because because you didn't see it the but in them let me just share my screen. Yeah, so in this park that I was, which was very basically oak oriented. could already start seeing other sort of Yeah, so for example, this one there's like a beech tree here. And this is already the mushroom but for example, on that this one might not have here the mushrooms. This is mushrooms.
24.139263153076172;-2.6211483478546143;10;Yes, these ones here, there's a couple of them there. Yeah, I didn't actually put a lot of yeah, there's a little bit going on here. Yes. But anyway, I'll send to you the edible sort of. So maybe you can Yeah, you can you can see if you can recognise some of the same species sort of growing around London. Oh, yeah. Can I ask if that like? Yeah, sorry, I'm sorry. Just like the the way that you describe of how you're treating animals from your habitat where you leave? Yeah. Like that's to try to create like a network a way of with other people of like community of CO living in a situation that maybe can be replicated elsewhere, that has this nice sharing session is like, different. I'm thinking of it as the library. And then there's library like, tech skill for digital skill for elders, like things like that. And this is what I think similar, but it's for everyone, like this live in the city, which could be something that we're kind of the one needs to learn the digital skills. As a skill, that's the technology. Yeah. So you're saying the question is how, how would other people be able to sort of access this or CO share these resources?
10.432196617126465;-5.3451409339904785;10;Yeah. Why are you sharing that? Like, in the long term with other like, or creating another? I'm thinking about? Hmm, yeah, I mean, on the website, we sort of share already the species that we found that are edible. So there's a sort of online resource that we try to share. And in terms of cities, I think it's interesting to identify the environments that still exist that have these sort of trees or possibilities of, of edible forest goods. And also to sort of expand them in, in sort of, yeah, I mean, it's all to do with access, isn't it, for example, in this in this place, that we're here now we're opening up concrete, and this is an association. So there's a lot of more elderly people, there's a younger generation of artists, and it's open to the community. So what we're doing is lifting up concrete and actually putting in plants that also, people maybe already had a seeds or little trees that wouldn't, weren't surviving anymore in pots and things like that. So they're being implemented in this garden. And we actually also planted a couple of oak trees, but that will take a long while to grow. So in the meantime, there's also other species. So this patio is it's like almost 30 metres by 20. So it's quite big. 
6.530291557312012;-4.342436790466309;10;But for now, we only have two metres by 30. Open, so it's just a big strip. But if you think you can open up the whole patio, that's actually a lot of food source. And I think there's a lot of those. I think in London, you see a lot of gardens that are still gardens. But in Porter, for example, a lot of houses they used to have gardens have been just concreted over, are turned into sort of warehouses, which is not really legal anymore, because you're supposed to have a percentage of porous soil, so you'd be able to access the soil. And that doesn't happen necessarily in all places. So I guess the idea would be to sort of take away the concrete out of a lot of city areas in order to be able to implement these sort of agroforestry systems, which is definitely possible. And it's where people are leaving. Thanks, Pietro. He's here by Pietro. Yeah, sorry, guys. It's getting late. I know he did start a bit later, but we can sort of Shall we end? I was leaving. Yeah. And he's the host so we should end. Cool. Thank you, sir. Thank you so much. Please bring some a call. My make some for sure thanks everyone for sticking around I hope you enjoyed it Thanks Sarah.
4.234034061431885;5.757417678833008;11;So my idea for today was maybe to start with presenting what has been done as part of this project. And maybe Eric could show our, our platform. I mean, it's still in development. But there's, there's some things we could present first. And from there from these processes, I think it would be quite organic to move to Cyrus Reese research. And then maybe we can we can follow with advice practice. And as this is going to be a more interactive activity. Maybe we can leave it as the last one. What do you think? Do you have any, any other ideas? What, what the order should be? Sounds good. I have like, just some things to show some audios to, to share, and some discussion to have. And then yeah, it would be very nice to end on, like, have some sort of limit and end on something interactive. Yeah. And and by the way, a thing on the email, the prompt battle was mentioned in tried to think we could do but I don't think there will be time for that one. And the prompt battle was about myself stuff for a while. And probably that.
15.803009986877441;13.525676727294922;11;Oh, yes, maybe maybe it you can just describe what that is really? And then maybe we can we can really do it in real life, as you suggested. It sounds super fun, huh. Eric, which would you like to maybe start and show? Maybe we can do this screen share? And then all the others, for example, what kind of work and processes way way they have in our constellation. And what what's your distribution model really does to text? And how this looks in space? Yeah, sure. So hey, I'm Eric, can you hear me? Yeah. Okay, cool. So I've been developing the hyperspace platform. And so I can just show you, some of you who are joining us for the first time today, you've not really probably not seen much before, I don't know if you've visited the public site that we have up and running at the moment. We haven't really been updating it for quite some time, because we've been working on the new build. So I can just kind of show you guys the old platform, and then what we've been doing more recently, I'm on my work laptop today. So it might be running a little bit slower. Can you see my browser? Cool. Okay. So basically, this is the platform that we have online.
15.398971557617188;18.876144409179688;11;So the idea, I guess, was to create a platform where we share our outcomes from our peer groups. We introduce the artists participating in the project, and then also provide some kind of platform for audiences to engage with our content. So over the course of this year, we've been trying out a few different ideas on how to do this. And then more recently, we've also been integrating open API's API's into our work. So the idea is to create this kind of platform hosts which is the hyperspace AI that is then we kind of instruct the AI to been in a certain way to kind of To give it some context on on the project. So I can show you what we've been doing more recently. So we've done a complete kind of design overhaul of the site, you can access it through the route of quora.com/private route. And here a lot of these things are still not working. So they're just kind of placeholders for the time being. But here, we have this constellation that we've been working on. 
13.576979637145996;19.0288143157959;11;So these are this is made from the transcripts that say, We've been recording these peer groups. And then we've been chopping them up into smaller paragraphs, and feeding it into this model, which basically a statistical model that basically kind of clusters the text based on based on its similarity. So looking at the kind of semantic content of the of the text, and clustering it based on that. And here you have a peer group filter, we'll add some more peer groups here, as we get the transcripts. And you can see that generally, they are kind of like each workshop is clustered very nicely in its own little region, which implies that the the language that we've been using in each of the workshops is very unique to that workshop, which is really interesting. Apart from the intro session where, where obviously, everyone has introduced themselves and their work, so we have bits here and there. And then the idea is to have this kind of hyperspace AI as I said, this is still like super work in progress. But the basic functionalities, so I don't know if I'm sharing my sound, I don't know.
-0.1612413376569748;2.1453912258148193;11;Every every every question is, was the peer group with Miko uploaded, we did this this session with with an activity around font or listening to phantom words. And this was a crazy transcript we ended up with I was curious if if the constellation included it or not. So what was the workshop called? It was the hyperspace voice Yes. Was it the becoming AI kind of thing? Yeah, maybe I gotta Yeah, I think so. And it did work in the engine. I mean, similarly to others. I mean, if it if it's this one, I'm not sure I think the labels we still have to look if they see if they kind of actually correspond to the workshop. Titles, I just quickly copied them from the emails, so. But anyway, so here you have another What are you doing here? Does anyone know how it can share? Sound through? Yes, you have to reshare and click Share computer sound so Oh, yes, I see.
14.743322372436523;18.350069046020508;11;The idea is. Hi there. I am an AI assistant for hyperspace, a project that seeks to create new ways of connecting making and sharing work. I am here to help the 13 artists in the project to collaborate, share ideas and execute their creative vision. How can I assist you? And the idea is that you can have a conversation with Apple and we've done some kind of little tricks with prompt prompt engineering so the in a way to kind of It kind of creates this memory for the Chatbot. So the Chatbot can follow the conversation. Conversation as you have the conversation. So it has some context, and then it gets fed, like the conversation recursively so that it kind of knows what you've been talking about. And then you can also can you picture of Santa, the birds. And then you can also ask for it to show you images of things. But then, yeah, this is still very much work in progress. The idea is that all the kind of generated content would show up on the right here first, and then after it's been shown there, it kind of gets added to this conversation log that you can see on the left. What's it querying? What do you mean? Is it querying some sort of GPT service? So yeah, so yeah, so we're using the open API API. So all the and then I'm kind of between this interface and the open API API. There's this kind of like intent recognition system where then the system decides whether to send the query to delay to generate images, or whether it sends the text to GPT. Three, so. So that's kind of this system where you can then make it appear more clever than it is. Basic. Yeah.
24.89752960205078;-3.4844207763671875;11;So like, in a way, there's some sort of like, like heuristics going on? Yeah. As in the brain is actually well, the so called artificial intelligence is a bunch of heuristics on their side. I mean, yeah, pretty much. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I noticed with this chap. GBT shit. It like, I mean, it seems a lot more intelligent, because it has some sort of like, rules that it follows. Yeah. And basically, I mean, I think I mean, I don't work at open ai, ai, and I don't really know much about their, their stuff, but it feels like the language models that are available through them are like, quite heavily filtered. So it's not just the raw kind of probabilistic output, but it's, it probably goes through some kind of Yeah. heuristic, free, or something, too. Yeah. That's quite a nice view, actually. I mean, I think it's important to raise because it's easy to fall into this trap of thinking these things are, like, transcend us, when in fact, yeah, there's kind of just some, there are like some rules, which are defined by humans. But it's not completely autonomous is what we want to say. Perhaps? I don't know, either. I don't. But it's interesting to discuss that. Yeah. I mean, I guess the I don't know their motives today. It might be safety. It might be for them not to get sued.
15.241020202636719;14.430907249450684;11;But then, there's also like, if you ask it to generate code, like a computer code, it gives a very, is there's a very typical style of response. A follows a particular format, is what I mean. Okay, yeah, I've never tried the codecs model. So I've not been testing it. But anyway, so that's kind of what we've been working on, we still have quite a lot of work to do before the final event. So it's, there's a lot of kind of small bug fixes that need to be done and and yeah, but it's very different to the old build every week to be able to give a little bit more detail how your model works. What's the process really, of treating the paragraphs, the pieces of text and then translating them in vectors? Because I was I was talking to Cyrus before. I will. I would be really interested in translating text, not only just into points in space, but also thinking if we could try is like that into sound. If there's any possibility of, of these processes that you do with text into point in space, it could also work with maybe some kind of sounds, sound distributional, some Sonic scattering news space. So maybe, maybe it would be good if you just say a few more words, what's happening in that process?
12.759177207946777;21.011211395263672;11;Yeah, sure. So I guess like, there are several ways that we could kind of approach it. So the first things that we do to the text is that we break it into paragraphs. And then feed those paragraphs into this kind of Term Frequency inverse document frequency. algorithm, which is kind of it's a very basic natural language processing algorithm where basically, we kind of create a. So each of these paragraphs is turned into a vector. And so a kind of list of numbers of values. And then we have for each unique word in the entire, we talked about a corpus, which is like the entire data set. So it's like all of the paragraphs combined. So we have a value in all of the vectors for each unique word in the entire corpus. So say, there's like 10,000 unique words, in the whole kind of data set. Each paragraph is then being represented by this, a vector like this, and then you just have kind of counts of the words. A lot of them, most of them will be zeros. But then you have counts of the words that they that are included in the paragraphs, basically. So it's this kind of like vector representation for each each paragraph. And then you can kind of think of each value in the vector as like a dimension. And then we basically kind of do some mathematical magic to calculate the similarity between those vectors. So I guess it thinking about sound, we could use the original input vectors. Or them, we could use the so this is then like a two dimensional mapping, like a lower dimensional representation of those. So each of these points originally was some kind of 10,000 dimensional vector, basically. And now, it's kind of mapped to this two dimensional grid here. By the way, sorry.
11.309825897216797;20.41332244873047;11;She's SNI, isn't it? So? Yeah, yeah. So there are a lot of different algorithms that you can use for the dimensionality reduction here, we've been using tesni and some PCA. But then, basically, like, you can use a lot of different stuff for that. They kind of they just differ in the way that they actually like cluster the text. But each of these basically, originally, it was like a 10 Dimensional 10,000 dimensional vector. So you can either use the original input vector for sound generation, or then we could use the two dimensional grid coordinates. But I don't know if that's, I don't know if there's any kind of variability in that. If, if I don't know if it's kind of like, if it's interesting to have, I mean, there's not a lot of information into numerical values, x y. So it kind of depends what. Yeah, and by the way, I really in this, I mean, hyperspace means anything more than three dimensions. And then we take something which like 10,000 dimensions, and I register again, to the which is not hyperspace at all.
9.612171173095703;19.274667739868164;11;Yeah, human eye. The human eye isn't hyperspatial though even though I can't see the hyperspace. So we need its way we need some to the human human spirit is hyperspatial concept So hyperspatial Though the physical world is maybe it is, I don't know, I don't want to get into that. Okay, great. So the question is What? What kind of kind of, like quality could be added to every vector to further representation to become more hyperspatial. That's why I've thought about sound because it adds another layer to perceiving this two dimensions inherently hyperspatial The perception of it gets not her. We can never visualise that, though. Yeah. We don't have to just visualise maybe we can also give it, we can experience it. Well, another way is like, you could find a way to navigate the hyperspace in n dimensions. So like more than three dimensions, right? We can map do mathematical operations to traverse say you have like a 3d cue, you want to move around this cube like a little fly, but then generalise that larger number of dimensions, arbitrary number of dimensions, I don't know, you could find what patterns emerge as you what, like relationships emerge between the text as you move from point to point.
-7.882592678070068;10.936141014099121;11;So maybe the problem is this static representation of it. We've I think we've had tie we were talking about kind of making it more active, introducing some movements, some change, that would express express these more dimensions in a little bit better way. Because at the beginning, we had an idea to kind of process every paragraph that that is represented by each thought, process it through the language model, and show its output. So let's say in brackets, that couldn't be also voiced. We then had a problem, because we were getting really not interesting outputs. And we never wanted to publish the text itself, because this is not the point of this, this whole work. And, and we decided not to do it, but hmm, maybe, maybe we output it, there's some output that we could share. That that is source in the paragraphs itself, there is not just a point in space, that is two dimensional.
9.059867858886719;18.097415924072266;11;So I don't really want to publish the original transcripts. I don't know. I think it's quite boring to just have some text here. And when we hover over dated points, or do we have the text what that is, Oh, no. Okay, so this is this exactly what I'm saying. We wanted to have a process text appearing, but we decided not to do this. But still, maybe this a different way of approaching it. And still. Yeah, So couldn't you like embed these texts in hyperspace transform their hyperspatial vectors slightly and generate a new text. But we were feeding the paragraphs to GPT free and we were getting such dry nonsense, okay. I mean, even though it's not boring, in my opinion. And by the way, this request for for a bit, I wasn't trying to say this, like conceptual flood or anything. I think it's lovely. I even loved running in this and this is the best presentation of hyperspace we can possibly have anyway, so I wasn't trying to indicate this flow door doesn't work or anything. 
-12.415204048156738;12.33939266204834;11;So what the idea I had was, I mean, since the amount of movement had a an integral role in the project, if we could have three of these things, and maybe even have been 3d, I think it can be done using P five I think I've seen some sketches with P five who utilise 3d T sneeze and if he if he could have to T Snee graphs, while static like this, which has all the human input which doesn't move and just one interactive T Snee, which will be the the responses of the AI to these human paragraphs or sentences which could which maybe could be generating responses every 10 seconds so it could be forever moving because of the texts will be changing responses will be changing. So that's That was one idea we had with regard to Antonia in a previous meeting to add some interactivity or movements, etc. I'm not sure the technicality or how it can be done. But the idea is to have an human AI interaction and to have some movement on T Snee. That was my idea.
7.1020002365112305;7.369042873382568;11;I made it be you know more about prom pant making, but when, when these paragraphs were really like, it was often just conversation between us. And the often there is not, not no specific content. So this GPT, three gets a bit lost, and he doesn't really know what to reply. I guess it was a problem with our prompt as well. I mean, we never finalised. Sorry, on Yeah. No, no, no, I'm just yeah, just wanted to say that. I think a lot of this and our frustration had to do the prompt. Did Well, I do have could be. How about? Would you be interested in this idea? Let's say when Cyrus said, I have some discussions, in the end, you could treat these zoom meetings, like a play. I mean, write the scripts of let's say, Cyrus's discussion beforehand, but only in terms of questions. Don't don't write the answers, but at least have the queries, which let's say, Cyrus will be raising in advance how they could play like script of the entire future workshop. I mean, then you can at least craft some prompts, which, you know, might work better in the end with the with the Jupiter fee. I mean, I'm sure none of this language we use now will be interesting in terms of Jupiter free outcomes. But let's say, as a part of Cyrus's discussion, if he had a question like, What is the nature of sounds? GPS, we can come up with something interesting, which we can, which you can at least see on the office space visualisation, and have interesting time reading it, but this way, it's really difficult to have interesting responses from the the the the algorithm play, like, even it could even make zoom calls. 
7.638874053955078;7.702174186706543;11;Interesting. You know, what I mean, to treat this kind of a parallel reality towards happening? One created by the Ethiopian AI? Yeah, you are at the other one, the one that actually happens during the workshop? Yes. Yeah. And when you have to play, like, almost Shakespearean play that we are acting on, you could have an instance, speech to text algorithm, asking some question that with, let's say, with Cyrus, and then instantly, feeling deeper for free with that, and then have at least I mean, the thing with Jupiter three, at least in my experiences, you kind of learn to craft the, to make a speech, it's a human basically, how would you engage with the human? It's like, how would you have the most interesting results? So we slowly can craft the prompts. And the discussion is a bit more play, like, in a way I think, both ways. It could make all of this more interesting as well, but I'm not sure just an idea. I think it's important to prune the transcripts and intervene and cherry pick inputs rather than taking the whole thing indistinctly and giving it to the to the GPT
8.933880805969238;6.920839786529541;11;Yeah, I think ADA is raising hand on our say I really liked that idea thinking of directing of like, like you could have the text beach on the for how to say have two people having conversation at one given a prompt and put into text to speech and the other person taking repeating the answer and then kind of the eviction implant with that sometime can be from that one out when it's recorded. And then you can see after I feel like that can be interesting as like, yeah. Is workshop, like directing and acting. And on the go a lot of stuff who is initiating a prompt? Yeah, I mean for every workshop or discussion like sacred direct too as well, because pick one. And yeah, we will be basically performing your play, which also has a hyperspace counterpart written by AI. All the responses. Yeah, it could be interesting. And if you can define what makes a question interesting, you might be able to even automatically ut particular or something to pull out these questions from the board transcripts. Yeah.
7.872934341430664;8.25459098815918;11;Like these what would you share how transcript with it? And then ask it to kind of filter through it? Is it possible to have like points of contact, like only conversation can happen on the phone or something over like how long you touch the string crater, the kind of parameter of how much text is shown, and making that a prompt? Yeah. I mean, I think if we can formalise in a way, every workshop, someone will write the prompts the questions, and we have the poetry open. As the this talk is going on, it could be interesting to, let's say, either provides an answer to the question, and then we add it to the prompts, and then we generate more, and then that's a guy that jumps in we have a bit more of an answer, then we talk and then we check the AR. So the response, it could be a bit more of a, an actual human participants. Sorry, like one of the participants in the workshop?
4.895673751831055;6.808940410614014;11;Well, I think if we pick this route, I think we're better off the to have someone at least direct the play. Let's say today, Simon said, in the end, I have some discussion points. We could reach a point in the meeting where we begin that discussion, written by someone today, Cyrus next time, maybe spiritual gods, are you. And then that part begins. But I think there's just one person who pre written the transcripts and the prompts and the I mean, the questions that we will be discussing. How do you think this could also be the, or the workshops that happened already? I don't know. I'm not sure that we could reenact we have reenact Yeah, you could reenact. So so every there were questions during every workshop, there was some some themes we were talking about. And I guess we could just feed that to GPT. Three and see what it would come up with, in contrast to what happened already. Didn't know. But yeah, that's very cool. I like the TC so much. Yes, sir. So we can definitely look at the three dimensional thing. 
-8.570878028869629;10.02758502960205;11;So let's visualise for the if this works. I think as well, I mean, if it works, no reason to upgrade at this point, maybe. And mean, you worked so hard already, obviously. So I think this is also lovely. There's really not much more you can do to visualise. Yeah, you can, you can just shout that it's eight dimensions and imagine it. Yeah. But But anyway, you were you were talking making a tasty, more dynamic. A possible thing you can do or there is but it's a bit tedious to implement is show which points are nearest to the point that you are currently hovering over. Because I've I think if I remember correctly, a weird property of when you take 10,000 dimensional space and you project it down to two dimensions, is that the points that look closest, honestly, necessarily the points that are actually closest in the full 10 dimensional space. And so you might be hovering over the bottom right corner and you know, many points To the bottom right might be near, but it might be a few points wherever on the left on the top. And that might be an interesting way of showing the secondary linkages between these paragraphs.
-8.987930297851562;9.624674797058105;11;Yeah, for example, that's actually really interesting. Yes, I think it's really interesting. John, John, what you said to point out more to the relationship, not the points itself, because they they're the points, they don't tell us much. But to visualise the spacing between these, or to present it in some some kind of a way that would be interesting. And that's yes, that was really think there was one algorithm when you hover over the the the vector, it connects all the relative and stuff isn't I think, on Google, Google's Teasley, for example, Ron Goss, Japanese era was appearing on the Japanese paintings, even though it's one guy, but when he pointed it, it could, you could see it actually is by someone else, someone from Europe, for example. So it could be interesting to point those when you hover over the vectors and space.
11.041434288024902;11.981810569763184;11;You can also add five more dimensions if you want. And you could add sort of red, green, blue channels to the colours of the points, you could change the size or the shape the points. And that is like tool people use when doing scatter plots, and they want to show a lot of data in a small space. But that might distract from this kind of like nice simplicity in a way. Yeah, yeah, I guess like we, that's something that we could do in place of the filters, because that's kind of what the filters are doing. But we're just not really colour coding them. So yeah, let's play around with stuff. Do you the same code you're using to show the filters might work for showing the nearby points? If you stood the n by n, medical something?
3.229316234588623;4.931173324584961;11;A little bit aware of time, and we still, we still have a lot. A lot to cover, maybe. Maybe we leave the discussion to the end. Maybe we can also we can now move to Cyrus and RTI and see maybe what Yes, what in your work could also add up to this discussion? Is it okay with everyone? Also, we we have another special guest. Today it's named that Linda Ryoko who's going to lead in, I think, the next workshop in the series. And she she she could join us just for a few moments. So I think it would be nice to also introduce Linda Linda, a security researcher. Oh, also dealing with technology. And in practice, she she does a lot of work around accessibility with within the arts. So I could just crash your meeting like this. But good to see you. Good to meet you. I look forward to our session. Thanks so much for joining and like maybe we could straight away go to Cyrus with the you think oh, we look forward to joining your session in January. Yes. I do remember that to date. Cyrus Would you would you like to? Present sent a little bit of your research?
12.130062103271484;25.473291397094727;11;Yeah, yeah, I wanted to discuss hyperspace. This idea of hyperspace for sounds. I don't really call it hyperspace. But I think obviously it's nice to explain what I'm doing what we're doing in sound. Research modern sound research with machine learning in terms of hyperspace. And because the discuss like, what's the difference between like, hyperspace of text type space of an image and hyper spaces of sound and like, what we want to describe in sounds in high dimension in hyperspatial dimension Do I do research like scientific research in machine learning, and signal processing of sounds, typically to sort of like extract information from sounds in hyper dimensional space, such that the relationships or the information captured from the sound represents relationships or concepts or attributes within the sounds in terms of their similarity. So in the same way, your you represent like similarity between paragraphs of texts, which might describe like, the sentiment of the text, the content of the text, the semantics of the text, the mood of the text, and so on. We do for sound, but you could say in a way, sound is like, sound can be abstract, sound can be concrete, sound can be specific, but often our language to describe sounds or the content of sound is, I would argue, it's, it's much more limited than our ability to describe the content of an image. Like, often with sound, there's not a direct correspondence between the texture of the sound in the soundscape. And the language we have to describe sound. Whereas an image is usually a clear correspondence between or individual domain that clear correspondence between what we see and what we can explain and put into words. And then obviously, with text, text has meaning already pretty much. That's a good question actually, like, what are we able to? Do we have accurate language to describe, like all sounds in like a in like a very, in a detailed way that can convey a lot of information.
11.563366889953613;25.95256805419922;11;There's an open question. Like, if you were to hear some and hear a piece of music, could you? Could you summarise it in language? And what words do you have to summarise sound? Yeah, MIDI waveform spectrum analysis. Exactly. So these are quite like, low level descriptions of sound. But what you hear is a pressure waveform. And then your brain makes some, some meaning out of it. But often, it's difficult to like describe what you're hearing or feeling. Maybe you can describe it in mood or emotion, maybe it's something much more visceral. But still, at a physical level sounds we can we can like classify similarity between sounds, we can categorise relationships between sounds, but often we can't describe them. I'm just trying to make this distinction and like point to what makes sound hard to model. So with texts with text, we have words, words are symbolic. And then we can represent every word as a vector in high dimensional space, as Eric described. And in this high dimensional space, words, assume sort of like conceptual and contextual meaning, and they are often related by their semantic and contextual similarity. And like, statistically, words occur in similar contexts, words have certain meanings. But with sound, we have to find some, some descriptions, like analogous descriptions that we can use to take the sound and put it into hyperdimensional space. So should we capture this sort of like, semantic content of the sound. But the problem with this is, like a sound, the sound that hits our ear is really high dimensional, and kind of has little meaning. But then what our brain does to the sound to encode the sound, such that it emerges into meaning is much different to like, how sound emerges in the physical world. So this is kind of like it kind of makes sound much harder to model in terms of similarity. Because, I mean, it's very hard to like, even describe sounds, in a lot of cases at like the final level of texture. So, one thing we do. 
10.066834449768066;24.77106475830078;11;As we often like, what I'm going to share today is like neural network approaches, much like what's used in this GPT and neural network to generate sound. And what these neural networks do is they analyse sound, which can be really high dimensional. So a sound can be made described over a second. In the digital world, we typically describe sound in like 40 40,000 values, which is extremely high dimensional, and is often difficult to for like a, like a, for a human to describe 40,000 values accurately, such that we could recreate some sound of interest is virtually is virtually impossible. So what we want to do is we want to find like a summary of a sound over some short time periods, maybe half a second, maybe a second, the sort of captures the the describes the texture of the sound, or describes the sort of semantic content of a sound in just the few dimensions. And when I say a few, I mean, maybe, I don't know, let's say, between four, and 128. 
10.804973602294922;24.708847045898438;11;So still hyperspatial, but a much smaller description or summary of the sound than what can be observed in the in the physical world. And then what we do is a hype as you could imagine a hyperspace as a cube, but a cube with n dimensions rather than three. And what these models do is they analyse the sound a map, map the sound over a short time interval, into some coordinates in this high dimensional space, think of it in terms of a cube for now. And then where it maps sounds to, in the cube. adjacent points will kind of have similar acoustic qualities. And we often don't know what these acoustic qualities are that the, the network or neural network will pay attention to. But they're the most important qualities of the sound, or the most varying qualities of the sound, that allow this network to then reproduce the sound that that analysed and generate it in coherently. From us just as like, like a summary of the sound. And then what we can do with this is because we have like a, like a hyperspatial, yet reduced representation of the sound. We can generate sounds in a sort of, like, controllable way. So what I've been doing is I've been, I've been training neural networks to generate like a data set of sounds that I curate. It could be like, your transcripts, like your speech, it could be like, albums of music. And I'm getting this model to sort of like compress or describe or summarise the whole, the texture qualities of the audio data, the rhythmical qualities of the audio data. And once it's learned how to do that, I can then like take some points in this hyperspace move around the hyperspace and generate sound from various points in the hyperspace. 
10.672511100769043;25.3739070892334;11;Much how like Eric demonstrated these, like these paragraphs of text, were represented in hyperspace. And when visualised in two dimensions, they kind of cluster and get organised based on their like, semantic similarity. And yeah, we train these models these neural networks to sort of like summarise Yeah, the texture of a data set of sounds, but I'm like, I don't know what the you guys think are the sort of qualities of sound that allow us to categorise and relate and distinguish them, like what makes us what properties of sound allows us to like? distinguish a bird sound from a car or a bird sound from music. This is what I wanted to ask you, you mentioned these 14,002 values qualities, you can that you can extract from a single sound is this is this some kind of equality that is perceptible to humanly form of hand. So this is a represent, we usually represent physical pressure, physical vibrations that are received at the air into like a wave form, we represent them as discrete samples. In the real world. That's not obviously the case. 
11.719966888427734;27.157276153564453;11;But we have to measure the we have to measure sound in a computer fast enough, like fast enough rate, such that we can like capture the all of the audible content in the sound. They're just, they're just values of fluctuations in amplitude, or air pressure vibrations, and that's what hits the ear. But what is happens in the brain is like a transformation and analysis of the sound like a description or decomposition of air pressure, which consists of like all kinds of frequencies, such that ones in the physical world can emerge into something with meaning. And there's like alternate realities, where the air pressure patterns that form speech would not make any sense to our brain. Like, it's just our brain has selectively adapted to be able to coherently analyse, like the patterns of air pressure produced by human speech into like, something that makes sense to the brain. But the task of the computer or the artificial intelligence is to create a description of the sound that captures these like describes the texture qualities, like so someone in the chat said, Sarah said, yeah tambor. Texture, pitch, rhythm, dynamics, duration, these are kind of like, pretty much if you were to inspect one of these models, like, definitely the things that you would find things that pays attention to reflection, resonance, echo and speed. Yeah. So again, these like relate to like, how the sound is being heard in space, that's another dimension of how we hear sound is like, like, its spatial location, the acoustics of the room, the sound is produced, or modify sound as well.
6.446477890014648;18.648395538330078;11;So if, if we, if we think about this, we, a human brain kind of limits, limits itself from being aware of some so much that has no meaning to it. So if we kind of opened ourselves to perception of non meaningful stuff, like what, let's say machines do what computer does, it's not, it's not looking for meaning because nothing really means anything to it, it is it is able to perceive so much more. So that's another good point is like, though it's very difficult for a computer to do all tasks of human auditory perception in the way that the human ear does. I'm referring back to the human ear time and time again, because right now the human is so much more powerful than the computer, while in like processing images, like that's why you see image processing so much further and language processing, seemingly so much further ahead than sound processing. Because we can't, the computer struggling to do a lot of basic tasks, like 
7.732155799865723;22.503158569335938;11;John said, distinguishing multiple overlapping sounds is like in an image. objects don't overlap. Well, they overlap, but we're not transparent. Like, we will only see the object at the foreground, right? If they're overlapping in space, where's your sound if two sounds overlapping. We hear them as separate sounds. But we need to find transformations of the sound that let the computer see that they're distinct sounds even though they're overlapping, but still audible. But what I'm trying to point to is like sound processing is far behind image processing, and text generation seemingly, and it's because it's hard. But what I wanted to show you today is some examples of real time and interactive use of these neural networks, which sound quite experimental. But give us some interesting creative results and we perhaps have a bit more control over what's happening. And mediation
6.605897903442383;19.63983917236328;11;I can't see you and if I may. I think I got an instinct point like many of these things like tambor and texture and without anything to a neural network. But it's it, there's some structure to the way that sounds, and you're very in. And it's just noticing that structure and play that into these dimensions. Yeah, and often that structure emerges. If we use the right tools, or the right models to analyse the sound that sort of usually we use tools that sort of reflect what the we believe the human ear does. And from that the structure emerges of how things are similarly similar in terms of their timbre, how things are similar in terms of the texture. 
12.900090217590332;26.765731811523438;11;And even though sound operates across time, we can find summaries of sound over different timescales into like a single point, much like we did for the text. The differences, text is symbolic. There's much less information of text over a given duration. Like where sound, the information is huge over just a second. So it's like really hard to like, describe and summarise it meaningfully into just like a single point in hyperspace. Anyway, I don't want to ramble too much. I think we've talked enough. Maybe we can talk some more after I show some sounds produced from hyperspace. And like, I'd like to describe this process of like, using neural networks to generate sound and like, what implications it has for I don't know, ownership, artistic creation. Artistic agency. And so yeah, if there's anything interesting, anyone would like to raise? Four questions. I mean, it's without context right now what I've said.
13.435831069946289;26.436729431152344;11;Well, I think it's just really interesting. How, like the fact that we we do struggle, so greatly to kind of represent information and sound. And I'm just yeah, I'm really excited to see if we do come up with some kind of informative and efficient way to capture information and sound and how we can do that. Yeah, it's, like going to change a lot very quickly. It already is. But one thing I just like to emphasise is like, you're seeing amazing things with GPT. We see amazing things with Dali. But we haven't really got any convincing text to sound representations. And that's because there's so much data in the world, pairing like text and images, but there's not much good data to accurately pair music and text, perhaps. I feel because simply, I don't know that the descriptions of sound and music are so subjective. Often like, it's most humans, most humans can describe a visual scene. But you've got to be quite well trained to describe in language, a acoustic or musical musical scene, particularly in like a meaningful and convincing way. So that's why we don't really have any really good, like, sort of text or sound generations. Yeah, I believe. I want to show now, some examples of training neural networks to generate sound. So I actually took receive some audio from you guys. One was speech. I don't know where the speech came from.
9.349799156188965;22.328060150146484;11;So just to let everyone know, we we get some voice recordings for Miko. That's who's working on our synthetic voice. And we also share these voices with Cyrus for for him to also do some work on that. For us to see about what happened to these recordings to me. Yeah, yeah. So unfortunately, the model I trained on your voice is something went wrong. But I trained a model on some of our various other models. I have one on speech. I have one that was trained on an album provided by a data by the artists pirela. I train some models on like, arbitrary sets of music that I curated, and the album of a friend. I wanted to illustrate In the process of how it can be used interactively, how it can be used as a creative tool, and what's actually like to kind of get your ears to sort of get an intuition for what's, what's happening. So the process is as follows like, basically, researchers develop these models that learn to take a sound, analyse it, project it into hyperspace, so summarise the sound over small time intervals, and then reconstruct a sound like generate the sound, again, from these vectors in hyperspace, which are which carry a lot less information than the original sound signal. But perhaps carry more meaning in terms of how the vectors in hyperspace are organised to to, to humans. 
5.95292329788208;21.508625030517578;11;And then once I've trained a model on some dataset, that data that I've curated, collected, I can then either I can do two things, I can ask the model to stochastically or generate generate audio in a sort of structured way. And after it's been trained, it's basically learning to reconstruct the audio that or the sounds that it was trained on in a sort of coherent and natural way, that sounds sounds sort of consistent and realistic to the human ear. Or I can put, put sounds that it hasn't heard through the model, which it will analyse and project into hyperspace. And then sort of find the closest approximation of the sounds it's analysing in hyperspace. And then resynthesize the sound in terms of the texture that it's learned from the sounds it was trained on, which will make more sense, when I show you these examples. Let's do a test. So I can't actually show you the generation in real time, because while sharing the screen, my computer will crash. But essentially, can you hear this?
8.640482902526855;22.90593910217285;11;Can you hear that? Yes. Okay, so it's not actually failing as bad as I thought. So actually, let's see if I can share this in real time with you. But what I wanted to illustrate here is I have this, I have this max patch, because this thing can run in real time. Like, these things have only been able to run in real time. More recently, maybe in like the past year, and before that they were like really slow. When I say real time, I mean, the sound like one minute of sound can be generated in less than a minute. So it can be used in sort of like an interactive context. But I'll just show you this Max MSP patch quickly, because it kind of shows the structure of this. Can you see this? It kind of shows the structure of, we'll show the structure of this model. So what's going on here is the audio is coming in is analysing the audio and representing it in terms of how many other 5016 values so we have a 16 Dimensional hyperspace. And each of these dimensions can be we can navigate along each of these dimensions with some controls I've created to transform the sound but it will map the incoming sound into the closest approximation it has for the sound in terms of what it's learned in terms of some point in hyperspace.
5.837759971618652;21.480972290039062;11;Let me see. So, I have a hyper dimensional space, but I can navigate along each of these dimensions. For simplicity, I stick to four. And then I basically what I do is I take I provide to the model some arbitrary audio, just some stock audio. Can you hear this So this is just some pre recorded audio which is quite conventional. And I would put this through the model to sort of transform its texture into the texture of the data that the model was trained in. So in this example here, I've trained a model on the album of a friend of mine and I gradually fade between the original sound and the sound being produced by the model as this audio is being fed through it and transformed into the hyper dimensional space that's been learned from this model. Okay so this point is various fading between this original sample and what was being output by the model. I think it will maybe be more apparent when if I show you on some percussive texture, and show how this percussive texture is transformed into the percussive texture in the style of this album, cut it. So, here's the original This is just like stuck in Ableton and this one is a recording as I try and progressively transform this original loop. So there's moments in here, which would make it really capture this sort of texture of my friends. My friends work my friends project and transform a seemingly like, mundane, generic percussive loop into something with a bit more character and that's evolving. And while I was recording that I was controlling I was I was controlling in real time, these controls which trance transform, what's being mapped into hyper dimensional space and traversing these hyper dimensional space.
9.9937105178833;15.989445686340332;11;I think something interesting would be to show this very recording of artists voice I took this one because it was a short one. Oops. I hereby verify that I hyperspace currently speaking, and that I'd like the script to create an over that version. So an older version. I don't know what Adam was trying to convey there. But I have another model that was trained on like just arbitrary speech by a variety of speakers in a very controlled environment. And we put this recording of add his voice through a model trained on the speech and we get quite some ghostly characteristic I hear by via Wi Fi, that I hyperspace currently sleeping and that I'd like to lay the script to memory over version so the points where it became more indistinct were when I really transformed what was being analyse as voice into parts of the hyperspace that which perhaps had like, like less acoustic meaning or could be an hour less intelligible. And then there's like this other pretty generic example of transcribing. Like, ordinary sounds like drum sounds, or environmental sounds into speech
10.185450553894043;15.294721603393555;11;That's the original sound and I'll play a blend of the original sound and its transformed version. And geta I heard I verified that I hyperspace am currently speaking, and that I'd like this script to create an over depth version of my voice. I understand that this over the voice can be used to create speech. So that's quite a nice piece of tech like relevant speech for this suffer a bit frustrated my recording from yesterday in the ghetto which is really interesting. Recorded maybe I can do it in real time. Let's see. That'd be fun second while I set this up from voice yes works really well Okay, boys don't feel excited. I had those things I'm travelling speaking life this gift of life though as I understand it, I understand that sounds like my voice together with together with the transcript any year, it might be interesting might be interesting to get a chance to work is there anything? See, we can just go no one can see. I actually I, I just feel good. I don't know what it is, as far as I know, as far as I know. It has to just remind you if you have Citrix and put speaker to speak, that is fine. That it's fine. It's I'm speechless. This one. It's fun. So it's fun. Like once we got to the point to pop I die by my mortgage motions slapped. Right. This way.
9.01875114440918;14.895596504211426;11;We Great. What are you waiting over me. Hopefully that version flourished. I have my voice for x I was dying. I had this this old release coming the mean, Beast. So what I found very interesting in interacting with voices with sort of different accents is it shows you that the model is aware of accent. So if it's only been trained on like, people with the native native English accent, which I think this model was, then it's going to sound a bit. It's still capturing elements of people's accents. But it might not be so good at reconstructing what was taken in if it hasn't heard someone's like, like that type of intonation of  particular language. Yeah, that was kind of fun. I want to stop for a second just to like, digest. I recorded a lot of these offline but it actually started working live, which was very cool.
14.361948013305664;28.211109161376953;11;So yeah, there's various ways to train these things. But one of the biggest issues for me is that like, the most interesting use for me is this sort of context, transforming sound generating sort of like unheard types of sound. But inevitably, like the most interesting, a lot of interesting data is artefacts that's created that were produced by artists. So proposes this question of like ownership like, if I were to train a model on someone else's work, and this model can produce outputs that like, kind of distinct from the original data is like how can artists who create the artefacts be remunerated? to, like, often training these things is like restricted to certain parts of society who have access to like computational resources. So that's one challenge. From a more like, I don't know, ethical economic perspective. Yeah, if anyone has any questions on those sounds that were just produced. I have many more to show, but I'm conscious We have little time.
7.386719703674316;21.80479621887207;11;Yes. Thanks so much. It was this. Was this created? So trying to kind of imitate? Would you? Would you give us an input to it? Yeah, exactly. It's trying to analyse the characteristics of the sound like someone said earlier, I don't know maybe the time or texture dynamics, articulation, rhythm of the sounds, and maps it to hyperspace, or its representation of this the sounds it was trained on and finds the closest approximation of the sounds it's heard before, and then reconstructs what you're putting into it in terms of the texture or whatever of what it's heard already. But when I'm, if I modify or modulate or deform the hyperspace representation, as it comes in with these controls, we get something that doesn't resemble the input. So you can you can basically represent every sound in these in these 1000s of dimensions you mentioned, yes.
8.797812461853027;19.832590103149414;11;Yeah, in this case, it wasn't that many it was like less than 100. But you, you can always, you can always see relationship between different sounds in shoni, many different levels. Yeah, usually, if a model is like, I don't know, controllable, or works well, some sort of relationships in marriage. And then we can interpret what this the the model pays attention to, like, what that characteristics of sounds are most important for its distinction. Because now I'm thinking of kind of translating, translating the relationship, let's say, between sounds, the space in between two different sounds, translating this into relationship, let's say between different points in space. Eric, Eric says, I don't know, I remember how many dimensions there were, to these points. But maybe the relationship between them could also be somehow represented, represented by the relationship between sounds. I don't know if it's possible to be done with different than in across different dimensions. Because different dimensions. So go ahead. Maybe let's leave it.
13.438127517700195;21.573087692260742;11;Well, we kind of, I think I kind of get what I got is a relationship is interesting, I believe. Yeah. And so we, we talked about kind of, so if we have two data points, what we often do with generative models, that you know, whether it's sound or images, we can interpolate between the points. So we can kind of, we can explore the kind of hyperspace between those points and generate kind of synthetic or fake data that doesn't necessarily exist. So we kind of explore the, the kind of region within between those points. And it's actually really interesting because I mean, so there's this thing called the manifold hypothesis. And basically, it says that so following this hypothesis, you have when you have this kind of high dimensional data, it's thought that the data kind of clusters naturally into kind of lower dimensional regions, so they like a swirl in three dimensions and then we can find these kind of manifold surfaces and then kind of find kind of controllability in them so that we can to kind of see if we're generating images of faces, we can kind of change this smile or change their eyes. 
10.891632080078125;20.15089225769043;11;So we can kind of find this manifold or this kind of path that follows. The eyes, for instance, as a feature. And I guess, I don't really know much about, I don't really know much about sound models, but I guess that it's also something that you you can do with sound is kind of explore this region between the actual. Yeah, we largely believe similar thing, many fold hypothesis in a high dimensional space, your, your, your data only covers like, a subset of that space is kind of like, say you had like, hyperspace is huge volume, like the same way that three dimensions is way more volume than two dimensions. But maybe your your information only occupies two dimension, no plane in that three dimensional cube. So maybe you only want to move along a certain certain ridge or a certain slice of your hyperspace, because 10,000 dimensions that you have text is just crazy, huge, huge possible, huge possible volume for your information or your text to occupy.
8.394424438476562;18.458316802978516;11;There's also some evidence that you if you have two types of spaces, you could find a mapping from one to the other, which tries to preserve the structure. Yeah. One of the crazy results I saw was someone doing machine translation. Normally machine translation, you have paired text with like being, say English and French, like side by side. But some people were able to use monolingual text from the two languages and embed them into these hyper spaces, find the mapping which preserves the structure the most. And then that did have sort of okay job of translating from one language to the other without ever having seen the same, like text in both language at the same time. I don't know, like doing that, from sounds to text words like probably sound the text don't have the same structure. So you wouldn't get like a clean mapping. But you could probably still find some mapping, which is the maximally has the same structure. And you'd might see some find some interesting relationships emerge nevertheless. Yeah.
16.371286392211914;-5.542393207550049;11;Yeah, I think I've seen the same same same thing that you're talking about. And it's it's pretty cool. It kind of I think it suggests that we kind of communicate using some kind of relationships between concepts rather than rather than kind of. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. This the same kinds of structures or force exists in different languages. Yeah. Really interesting. Thank you so much for your input, but maybe we should move to this. Is we quite tight on time, and maybe we could continue the discussion at the end. What do you think? Would you like to take over at night, and a bit of your work? Thank you again. Thank you, Cyrus for the fantastic demo. I really loved it, especially the burial bit was really interesting. Thank you. And yeah, maybe I should do a small intro. I'm a tie. It's my first time as hyperspace thank you again for the invitation. I got some I know, I think I know a few of us higher spiritual. I've heard of others word before. But I'm really happy to be among you. 
5.1687798500061035;10.013225555419922;11;I love the website as well. And yeah, I'm basically a musician and I do have paid for a venue in London called effective I'm sure again, some of you know. My background isn't as the past thairis I'm a researcher. I haven't done CSR but I'm, I think, a bit more of a naive hobbyist when it comes to to AI stuff. off, but I think around 2017 Or maybe even 16, I came across magenta. And I was purely as a joke trying to make a fix when models using some of the RNNs and stuff. So I think 2018 I met duck this egg from inside the festival and then Calico and we had lunch and since then I'm a bit more involved with the testing of algorithms I've been testing the the Ableton plugins before they published and so on. And even though without me being noticing it nowadays I find the the especially open AI stuff the Holy Trinity jukebox Jeep industry and Dolly dolly to at the core of my practice, even though I wouldn't call myself someone who specifically and solely uses AI but in a way when zoom out of my practice, I think it's at the very core of what I do these days. I'm going to show you what I do in a short while but I think this is the background of mine naive intro to using AI stuff. What I do these days is it's a bit of a funny story I think to around three years ago I was making these mashups made by my play you some days May I share my screen and my end sound Am I allowed? Let me check if I can do we can make your host this helps.
5.606065273284912;10.57538890838623;11;And okay, what happened is, I think two years ago I was making these mashups. I'm going to play your chart now which was like a mediaeval hyper pop track drinkin? mean I've always been someone who was obsessed with making my own sounds and my own music, but I didn't know why purely as like a joke. I started making these mashups. And maybe you've you know, chocolates has three tracks, one mediaeval track one girl fan of the Year from PC music and a sceptre, a grime artist, maybe some of you know. And then I was like, how would I even be able to release this music to avoid copyrights. And then I began my making my own jukebox models. I had my own Piper pop model, my own mediaeval was my own grime model and so on. I 10 made these type of music which again uses jukebox mode as I can which kind of is an AI model again by open AI I'm not sure the opener jukebox if you've never heard of it before. It's just like what's hard to describe. It's a neural network that generates music but you can train your own models. Use the pre trained models to make your own stuff but it's a bit heavy as far as explaining see what the hell but you can find collab notebooks if you want to try around and to avoid those copyright issues. I then made stuff like this. The the model now singing on strike is pure, rigid box.
11.129443168640137;7.8665852546691895;11;You can see, it's like pure gibberish. It's not saying anything but I mean, I liked the sound of it. But the funny thing is, you can hear some words like pitches, which you can guess it was in a training set quite frequently. So you Maybe just one more this was a sound I recorded on a bus at the night bus people you can hear people speaking first but then it will slowly change into like almost like a barrier like rhythm right so yeah I mean to me I think it was like the people speaking in the night bus then making strike was a very ghostly the rhythm yeah it's all just one one generation the rhythm is generated yeah yes and just maybe one last example this was like a mediaeval model present John Totland This is the version generation it just one bit which I'm gonna play later and then make a new track date and then make this track diversion diversion yeah so to me I think you know why it became saris one more in spring inspirational CT scan paste on chat so even though I think we don't mean realising all of these jukebox and deep two three and building champions show later on became a way to create I guess, to it was initially to override the copyright issues, but then became a decor really one I think to maybe to go back to what Tyler said about copyright issues I would claim a track and give you a bit of a secret but don't tell anyone. I made a track based on by the you know, the welding the grime artists. 
10.913134574890137;8.54434871673584;11;And then it was like I shouldn't tell anyone because even if they know that it's based in wildly it's a grey area in terms of copyright and law. So when my friends are like oh, like Wiley, I told sometimes I'm like guys, oh really doesn't sound like wildly but yeah, it's I'm gonna play your track driving you try right. Well as you can see again the vocals are pure gibberish but I think in the texture of the vocals maybe it's a bit difficult to tell when it's in the mix and attract but when you solve it the workers are able to you can hear it's quite clearly it's inviting but anyway I think this is my history using the audio side of AI now move I can move to the more visual aspects I think darling is quite famous these days my relationship with darling goes back to the deepest fee I've been invited tried up to three years ago since then I know opening out Natalie we always keep in touch about the new stuff they came up with. So when they made dolly they dropped me an email to be on the the early testers programme to test out the biases the errors and stuff. So I began making some even again without me realising it so I'm making some points today. One was this which I'm not sure you maybe have asked me let me find it okay, I think I can stop it here so I can see no, sorry can see it now. 
6.820681571960449;10.65829086303711;11;When I was making the music as well, by some mistake, I made these images of official instruments with Dolly you can see slowly from the signature on right below. So I found inspiring in terms of when I was making the album which haven't been released yet but I was imagining I think the sound of these instruments even though these aren't real, obviously, but it kind of became like a self induced inspiration for me I'll be making these images and then go to my studio and be like oh how about on this track this bow on the dark side we'll have like in the end trying to make the sound of the the bow which apparently is in a museum now and when I was showing this to a few friends and so on a fan was like oh maybe we should do this things in real life I was and then we last week just exhibited these again dropping this is a go back you can see the one on the upper left the top row second from the left. I think we took that purple one as core shade which was because it's really I think one of the simplest ones and then and so that one and the one on the low the bottom row second from rights we try to make a hybrid of those and make this this is real image by the way this is an actual instruments in 3d and we 3d printed and uncoated them to quit an actual non working it's not functional it doesn't do anything really but it's a physical object now and this um loot and this guitar like unplayable leaves basically so even though they have no purpose in real life, but I don't know why I just love the idea of creating something with Dali and for the fun of it making them real objects like this wait this is real the these are real. These are real. 
-11.524360656738281;11.386710166931152;11;How did you print them 3d and print them? Yeah, a friend from France Simon 3d printed them and his partner Rosalie did code the real that's crazy. So I think this was the the most the project I've spent the time most on using Dali or any visual AI project Then lastly, to show you what I've been doing deeper to free this is basically Dave and initially what I'm going to show you the Randor of them Dave 3d model them first and then this was the model the 3d model made, I think blender. So just by looking at the images, they've created a 3d model and then printed it on 3d. So they Yeah, they're based on pictures, they delete made pictures, but then modelled and then 3d printed. I really didn't know at the time. This was real. These are real, I mean, can't really tell you the line between reality and unreality.
12.292181015014648;8.976555824279785;11;So be honest, I mean, now when I show like a story or a post, now one common thing I found is like, is this real? Or is Dolly and even myself I was like when I'm scrolling through images on my phone, where it's like a building and like, was this dolly or some AI? Or is this a place I've been really been to it really even messes up my mind sometimes. But let's not waste too much of your time. I'm going to show you my GPT three work let me see if I can well they were just start from this whole of all of this project more I started with Dolly GPT three and jukebox is just under the hood of just one big multimedia project now I don't know why but it's it has a overkill of a name, which is this Can you see what I've highlighted on the the Bandcamp page I'm just going to paste on chat as well. So you can read I noticed really cringy it was like a joke again a few years ago but now is the core of my practice this allegorical chancel which I think you can see the name on chat now with GPT three I've the way I used it was if this saves Council this governmental body was real. I was thinking it should have some government documents and then I made this I'm going to change my screen one seconds can see okay, this basically is a 20 page path that I've written using GPT three I'm going to quickly scan the pages this is allegorically the this Council's governmental or leaked documents. It is all fictional and documents these weird encounters like let's say just like the the chat we just had like the blending of fictional reality or delusion and reality. It documents all of these confusing algorithms the the people go through because of these in a weird way. Maybe you can click the Read some bits in case you're not sure but maybe I can assume a bit. No no just gonna maybe slowly scroll down. So if you want you can have a sense of it by just even reading some bits from it.
4.967851161956787;7.619812488555908;11;And what was the process of you writing it with GPT three. Okay, yeah. What was your experience? One second. You may miss a start from the process. Okay, here's for example one screenshot when I began making this I had no idea or any expectation to create these but let's say the the prompt was I think you know by now the bold bid is the prompt i given it was a beautiful day in the construct where you were testing on clouds and could barely hear against him which I know maybe this house you know what the gas in case means to steam from the hill below then a continue blah blah blah. I think that the first paragraph is it was interesting but then the bit below your chances of survival are one in what actual far I mean, why would you tell me after all of this weird because a beautiful day blah, blah, blah, but your chances of survival are one in in eternity. So I would be let's say having this weird generation taking the spirit serving on a Google document and then having this random piece of text like maybe 100 pages of random text like this maybe one more example
5.477635860443115;7.7695231437683105;11;Yeah, the again the bolded bold bit is the prompt. Again think was a random text or written or read on a book I have no recollection of what that was the bold bet. But I think from this long text I've taken the debate in the in the middle I guess there was no real path to follow I was in front of all my ancestors they were young in the future, but they still need me eternal moment I heard their voices I saw their faces in fashion of time they smile when I smile and they cry they cry for me and so on. I think I took that bit for example, turn that into a lyrics and then made a different track. And again this will be maybe too much of a confusion now, but with jukebox the music as I just showed you to make run tracks you can feed in lyrics. So I will be taking these bits which depict the three modes and then giving it to jukebox and then making that say Graham track or a fourth track or make it even a mediaeval singing model sing those beds for me I think that both bed in the middle their voices hang in union. I've again to continue the prompt again edit that back in then maybe a bit more. I'm just one more example. Yeah, this is like Well, I think the deputy fears stuck on a cool loop. I think some nations now now now now now now. No, I mean, you know, there's like a tense to it. Because when you're in a simulation, there is no end. So I think even the see that even Jake post model realised that kind of a paradox was quite interesting. So I think on the prompt here I was trying to make you write an essay, which allegoric the I have written but I failed. Maybe one more this I remember this one this bold prompt denoted by OPEC death metal band, does anyone know the band?
8.318577766418457;10.050381660461426;11;But anyway, it was like a lyric as I was the central track was put on the lyric and then this was the generation maybe one the last one. Yeah. But anyway, when I was testing these I had no I had no plans or I had no and go to realise I didn't want to make the capacity or I don't want to write a book. And to be honest, I think my practice or maybe not practice but my idea of thinking about these tools is not to put them forward. I don't never put the medium in front of the concept or the idea. I'm not against saying books like PHARMAC AI like Canada is bad but I'm I will never put the The medium in front of the work I do. So, for example, this perfect was exhibited at a exhibition a few months ago. And these pages put on again and I think even also, by the way, again, just to underline all of this text in this perfect or compiled from the GPT, three generations, all my favourite bits were somewhat curated to create these pages. But even going back to exhibition, when someone asked me how I written these things, I realised I haven't even thought of this as in an AI generation to me, it was like I written all of this. So I was like, Oh, who wrote this? But to me again, it's purely or not purely but it's a it's mostly me really. For you, oh, you can see now how that that ended up in this page. 
10.018799781799316;7.744856834411621;11;You can see the prompts, but now that we know you can see the prompt on top and then maybe it's one generation two, three, I can maybe zoom a bit Can I zoom on now but anyway, you can see how this was constructed so yeah, I think this is my practice using tick box tick typically three and Dolly apart we've got the the food but yeah, I think this is like my practice using the patisserie jukebox and dolly to create this whole network of ideas and network of text, visuals and music. So if this was a bit too random, I apologise how we kind of made sense. Hoth is being rather new it's trying to it's all coming to him just now. It has multiple layers, the text the visuals, the music, but I think all of this will make sense where has it all been properly released? And I have a text but I'm really inspired by the the how I mean how all this like let's call it the the trinity of open AI the jukebox Jupiter three and the Dali can we use in in conjunction with the conjunction can really become inspiring for me so yeah, I think that's my modus operandi. Yes. I love this bit. We all have lost now chasing the flags of dismay. I mean, come on. And maybe I can show you my favourite generation yeah this one I think I was like reading I was I was really impressed. The truth is like a lion. You don't have to defend it. But lose it will defend itself was like really? Well done. Do you prefer free but yeah, swing.
8.9788236618042;9.628652572631836;11;I find it really nice. But very interesting that you're using these tools, not because they are tools with certain aesthetics and things or tools with certain connotations or the fact that you want to be a labelled an AI artist but you're really like carving out in via distinct Modalities text, image and sound a parallel reality of your own. Exactly. I mean, it's consistent across a story and a story and then like, like, like a like a I you universal messed. who you are. Oh, what do you say? Sorry, couldn't catch the last bit. The universe. Oh universe. Thank you. As in it's not you're not just taking the AI as his AI or whatever, and spitting out. stuff. I am very well let's say I hear a sentence like oh, we made the pictures with a AI, I am really off put by that I mean, I'm Yeah. Put it in front of the put in front of the medium. They use the correct word. It's a bit perverse idea what the work is about. And if you have an idea, if you reach a point, and you realise the only way I can realise this idea is by using AI, I think that it becomes interesting. And I wouldn't be able to this book, I wouldn't be able to think, right, I wouldn't be able to see. But I think I like the idea of when enables you to create stuff, which you literally wouldn't be able to create. I think that becomes interesting. Really.
8.76276683807373;10.97605037689209;11;Yeah, I get put off as well. someone does something with AI, which doesn't need AI but it draws it there. The purpose is to draw attention because it use the tool Yeah, carry on. I mean, I remember this quote by Douglas ag from Google's magenta, it was like these are infill tools, but we want to create new kinds of artists. So when I see people like I don't want to give names or anything and I want to pinpoint to anyone who I don't like but one day that sits upon effects too and I made stuff and especially when all these people like open AI Google and stuff try to teach these models to learn about the semantic content the the the contents of an image it's pointless in my in my brain to again abstract those images really felt like a live with them it really can create a new worlds my opinion.
8.66087818145752;8.33188533782959;11;I think this is so interesting, what you mentioned about the relationship between content and form. And this is a little bit of what I was similar to what I was thinking listening to your music, there is this kind of language of no content these voices that you describe as gibberish and it kind of kind of concerns that it could be something but it's not Yeah, it's it's interesting when the form takes over the content too. Yeah, and by the way, I mean, it doesn't necessarily needs to be the case for example, this track I made trained on Nick Drake Do you know Drake by chance the the English folk singer, maybe some of you know one bit I really liked his when you say make a track using the AI, sometimes it just fades into some dialogue. I'm going to play your track, which begins by him playing a guitar and then singing some stupid GPT female lyrics, but then it will slowly fade into a chat like yours I got a term and you can hear some words in it. And when he does like words, like like, I think there was like sin some higher dimension being talked about it really becomes really, really ghostly. I'm gonna play you that track notes.
2.429427146911621;3.8624062538146973;11;Have to drag singing and playing the guitar and this is not the dialogue of Nick Drake. Talking to someone who we don't know. I mean, he might be someone who's dead now. And you hear that person talking to be in a very gospel voice to someone about a higher dimension. Slow morning. He denied in some jobs. there's always like this dialogue, maybe it's a bit difficult to hear from zoom. But I mean, to me these things really feel weird to witness. Yeah. But anyway, so if this wasn't too rambley Yeah, it was amazing. Thank you so much. It's been quite a rich session, I would say. And I need to slowly go as well, because we need to be conscious of time. And we had this idea to do a little bit of collective writing, but maybe there's a chance we could maybe meet on another on another day. 
3.1804215908050537;6.13746976852417;11;And be okay. I'm sorry. I had no idea how long these take. It's, it's, it's great. I think we've covered a lot. And I think we also maybe everyone needs time to digest, I think so as well. And also, there's going to be more people, because we've already know Sarah had to go. And I think it would be nice to have as many of us as possible for the writing. So maybe if if, if you're available, maybe we can think of this meet meeting another time to to experiment all together. And see if we can come up with some, some text for for the platform. Because at I had this amazing idea about writing an Oracle, that would create some kind of scenario for, for the chatbot that, that Eric's working on. I think it would be great to experiment. With these extend semi fictional stories, that could become a narrative of the experience of the platform itself. But maybe, maybe we could do that on on another time. Okay, when I'm done for anytime, really, I'm quite free. So let me know. Okay, so let's maybe give some time to ever and forever ideas, and maybe find the most interesting bit of everything that we covered. Maybe we could go that direction, then.
4.159290313720703;-15.23264217376709;11;By the way, so this meeting isn't stopping because of me is I really didn't want to like it's more than more than two hours. And some people also had to leave because of some commitments. So I, I think it was a very Yes. Full full session for everyone. And maybe we could continue where maybe we could continue the conversation. Yeah, I think it would be great to come up with a data data and ask everyone for availability. Yeah. Great. Okay. CEO, that we have about the next meeting, and really happy to meet you again. We'll be sharing both of you today. Thank you. This was really generous. It's been very special. It's very cool to see the platform Eric's building and what you're building as well. Nice, happy happy to open the conversation also between the different practitioners. I think some really cool stuff might come up. If the Yes. thing more about some crossovers and how to integrate these different models. ways of perceiving the world. Okay, then see your Thank you. Thank you again. Yes. Thanks so much.
18.320363998413086;-37.65483093261719;13;Okay. Yes, thank you. Of course. So, yes, I co collated a few projects, um, to sort of for the points that I mentioned in the email. Basically, uh, specific to access and talking about looking at access in different sort of, uh, points. And then also the mention into my research. Um, I was thinking of just doing the short presentation, maybe I think it's gonna be longer than 20 minutes at all.Uh, and then maybe we can sort of do something a bit more active. Uh, uh, I, I played a little bit on a, my board. Um, then I'm gonna you to, to think a little bit more about what you're going to do, what you've done, uh, what will happen with, with, with the resources, the knowledge, the exchanges that you had, um, through hyperspace.
18.87236213684082;-36.84033966064453;13;So just a little bit of a activity. But this is very fluid, so well, feel free to stop me if, if I'm talking too fast or if you don't. Uh, or if I'm mentioning things that maybe might not be clear, um, please stop me. Um, cause otherwise I, I keep going . Um, but yes. So let me share my screen. I'm thinking, yeah, lemme do this. So this is me and these are my contacts if you wanna get in touch. Um hmm. Okay. So yes, as I said first bit, I'm gonna talk a little bit Oh, away. Cause I need to move your faces, otherwise I won't read. Let me go back. I mean, your face is just so quiet in the middle. Uh, but it's fine. So, yes, uh, a little bit of what I do in terms of curating, producing, and consulting specific to access.
15.22150993347168;-38.53264236450195;13;So, uh, I. Both curator and produce, um, often festival of exhibitions, um, with deaf, disabled, neuro divergent artists. Um, meaning thinking both about the conceptualization, the formats, the artists selection, inclusion, but then also the production there. Uh, so actually making the things happening, um, with all the logistics around it, which might be the sometimes the least interesting part for me. Um, but it happened that I had to do it because you don't always have the luxury to only be the curator and then also having a producer. Um, so I've done both sort of, uh, roles often, um, producing, especially when looking at access can be very energy and time consuming. So before putting on an event or thinking about organizing something, Aims as, as a specific public.
15.325313568115234;-41.1988639831543;13;I really encourage you to think about and really make sure that you really wanna do it because it's, um, it's a lot of work. Of course, there's lots of rewards as well in doing it, but, um, but it's a lot of work. The, the sort of the production around, uh, access. And then I also consult, um, in the sense that I ma I work with organizations. Especially arts organization need to make maybe the organization were accessible, looking at how they deal with access. Often they have staff, um, they might have some sort of access needs or they wanna have staff, um, they wanna bring staff, a bit of a diverse workforce into the organization. So we sort of, um, work on that. And now I'm also doing a consultancy, which is really interesting, pairing some disabled artist with organization in the southeast of England. Um, so it's, it's quite interesting. I also do more traditional stuff, but I guess I will talk about it later. So the work on access to, to me follows the social model of disabilities.
13.141528129577637;-36.74053955078125;13;You might be aware of it, you might not. Um, which is sort of com versus the medical model of disability. The medical model says that you are the person that is faulty as you cannot walk, you cannot talk, you cannot. Um, so sort of puts the fault and the problem in the individual. Whereas the social model of disability basically says, well, society was built in a certain way, in a certain average sort of, um, Unical way, and people that have differences that might be related to the brain to how they look, um, might not fit within those categories. Um, so put the, the problems, not really about individual, but it's about how society is run, manage. And it was designed centuries ago, uh, by people that pretty much look the same. Um, and we all know how they look like. Um, so yeah, the social model of disability, it's, it's something that, it's very quite known in the uk.
15.640018463134766;-42.07161331176758;13;Lots of disability led organization know about it, talk about it. That's what they follow. Outside the UK is less known, but it's something quite interesting to think about to me as well. Think about access, um, in this terms. Um, So, yes, uh, as I was saying, I see access as something that can be really creative and it's really stimulating to curate and support artists to think through access and accessibility from the very early stage of the work. Um, I don't think it's an add-on. It never really work when access. Just something that you consider at the end of your work. Uh, oh yeah, maybe let's add a B S L interpreter. Let's add some, um, captions. It never really works when it's at the end, but when it's embedded into thinking about the work, it can really gives you entry points and thinking about different things.
10.430346488952637;-41.48329544067383;13;And as I followed many artists towards thinking about access, I've seen really how that really stimulated their thinking and the shaping of the work. Also, access is not universal. You might see some events and some people talking about, Events or format being fully accessible. And that's to be, to me it's a bit like a Disney movie because things are never fully accessible, especially as I just showed you the, the social model. Something that might be very accessible for some people might not be accessible for others. A very simple example, ramps, which is one of the easiest way when talking about access provisions, of course, work well for those that cannot do stair. So wheelchair users or people working with a cane but are very bad for, um, blind or visual impaired people.
13.112144470214844;-40.92790603637695;13;This is just an example, but there's many, many more. Um, to say that full, full access doesn't exist and it's always sort of like trying an error and it's really what, what works best for the artist and for the work. Um, So, yeah, this is an example of, um, a work that I've commissioned as part of Liberty Festival, which was this festival that I curated that produced with the Mayor of London in July. And you know, David, I'm sure, cause I I've seen you, I've done a workshop with David, um, and we, before the festival we commissioned some r and d works as well. And he wanted to work with, uh, 3D printing for the first time. And printing on scale, on on human scale. So we had lots of conversations and, and the, the festival was in Lewisham. And the sort of brief, uh, for the commission, for the commissioning pot was that the work in an r d stage needed to engage with Luha in some ways, with Luhan residents, with blueish some themes, um, as board of culture cuz Luan was 2022 Board of Culture. So of course as many calls, I'm sure you've done loads of many applications, there's always criteria that you need to follow.
17.416412353515625;-38.71805191040039;13;Um, and we can talk about that a little bit later as well. So he pitched this idea of, of, of making that was basically reflecting around the idea of public sculptures and, and wanted to elevate sort of like a common residence into, uh, the sort of becoming a sculptural figure. So what it means to sort of, uh, bring on a plane, to put on a plane for some sort of, um, everyday, um, resident and worker. Uh, so we started to think about who could be the subject. And that was in a, in itself a really interesting process. Cause as you know, David cannot see, he's fully blind. So, of course, how to make the process of finding a subject in, um, that wasn't just transactional or just tokenistic, you know? Um, and then of course, you know how to deal with it for, so not only for an artist that can see, you know, that could be tokenistic, and then if you add the fact that we cannot see, they would add another layer of, of, of complexities, uh, in the work.
14.468828201293945;-39.030006408691406;13;So he started to do sort of interviews around and speaking to people in Louis Shama from the Corner Shops, guys, and, and they were all mentioning this St. Stella is a community worker. She, uh, works in so disco canines where she, uh, gives food for people from, uh, lower social economic backgrounds or migrants. And she was very well known in the, in the community. So we connected David to Stella and they started to have this, this conversation, which is mainly what is really needed and, um, to do a work like this conversation with, with lots of care consideration exchanges until Stella agreed to be part of the sculpture. So, um, of course, um, um, we paid Stella for the time that she was, um, engaged in being sort of 3D scan and printed. And then, uh, to give the sort of feel of, of sculpture. Then David decided to cover with this sort of very grainy, uh, painterly sort of sand like cement. Uh, he work with an assistant David himself.
14.422268867492676;-40.51961898803711;13;The process wasn't really easy. Uh, some, some artists have assistant have been working with since ages. Some others need to find, uh, new ones. Um, but eventually the, the, the collaboration was really successful and, uh, the workforce has embedded some bra, um, mentioning Stella's stories as well as a plague at the end. And. . Uh, and of course then we had lots of conversation with David about how to make the work accessible. So for other audiences, not only visually impaired, but they might have other type of disabilities. And so he decided to consider the sitting position of Stellar. So he decided to add this chair that can be moved so the table can be accessed by wheelchair user with this idea that people would sit with Stella and have a meal, um, very inform. Way. And then the work was placed, uh, in a public space, in a cafe, uh, and now still exists and it's in, its in Louis. Um, so for, this was a really interesting example of, of, of how you can think creatively about access, but also how, um, access can really facilitate the making of some incredible works for them.
12.370772361755371;-40.84996032714844;13;It'll never work with, with 3D printing, and now it's using it daily almost. Um, so, so this is an example of one of the work, um, I've, I've followed in commission. This is another example and it's, um, stole from Liberty and is a VR experience. Uh, so this was wasn't present at the festival. It was only present in the first stage of the r and d showcase, and it wasn't present at the festival, mainly because, um, the artist kind of overdid herself through the r and d process. And that's the best, something that maybe we can talk about it later. The funding was for r and d, so research and development. We weren't expecting a finished work. Cause you know, it's, it's, it's, it wouldn't make sense to present something that it's already finished, but the artist works so hard that.
15.567763328552246;-39.54652404785156;13;They, they overdid themselves by the r and d showcase. They present this work that was incredible, almost basically finished, ready to be, to be displayed and performed. Um, and by the time of the festival, they, uh, didn't have the resources to do it again. They didn't have the energy, um, which was a little bit of a, of a shame and also a, a lesson on the artist on myself as well to really make sure that during the r and d, it's a really research and development stage and this need to perform to show that you can do it, especially when someone is disabled or, or from, from marginalized background. It's, it's very present, right? You need to sort of overperform to show that you are, uh, warfare or, um, and, and, and so, you know, it's just a consideration of, of, of, um, Of a process and said, didn't need to be, uh, so finished. But the work was incredible. It was a VR experience of, uh, forest, um, that stretches, that was well stretches from Lu and Croon.
12.313623428344727;-38.97180938720703;13;Now this forest doesn't exist anymore, per se. Uh, and it was a piece of immersive theater. So again, the artist never worked with VR before. Uh, she managed to find this, um, guy that does sort of immersive theater experiences. They connected, they produce this vr, uh, so you're going through the forest. But then again, thinking about Access 360, uh, the performance were of course, uh, performing the story of this forest, very sort of theater based. And they also had a BSL interpreter that they brought in during rehearsal. Um, so the BSL interpreter was also acting and, and really be part of the performance. And then they developed this sort of structure to look at the VR where people could also sit or could also lie. So as well, thinking about people with multiple, um, physical impairments, they could actually. Fly on on it and experience this, this scene in the VR where you are flying over the forest. And it was quite incredible to be able to lie and fly with some great feedbacks, especially from people with, again, physical impairments or limited mobility. Uh, there was a scent of the forest she worked with with, um, A person developing the scent.
16.39462661743164;-39.55073928833008;13;And also, as you can see, the actors also had leaves and all these, um, devices that could, uh, um, facilitate touch. So they were really giving an immersive, um, an immersive experience and, and it was really brilliant. Uh, another reason why the piece didn't make it to the festival, and it's just a consideration, again, I'm just planting seeds, hoping that it's helpful in some way now or in the future, is that, um, so the artist managed to collaborate with this really sort of, uh, good and known VR maker, so was actually making on Unreal engine the whole vr um, experience. and the collaboration went fine. The, the, the, the, this person who did it was a bit, um, scattered. You know, it wasn't always replying to email, which is fine. And if you ever work with people with techies, you kind of know that they might be actually very busy coding and, and whatever, and maybe not be as responsive.
10.485424995422363;-35.814064025878906;13;But what happened is that unfortunately at the end of the r and d period, there was a lack of communication and the artist didn't have the VR piece. There was nothing in place, no agreements. So basically the person that did the tech, the, the VR scene just basically disappeared. Um, and the artist didn't have the piece, didn't know how to, um, enact it again, use it. And so again, a bit of a, now they might be fine and they might have been in touch again. But again, something to consider who, of course, not only who owns the work, of course the intellectual properties are very fragile again. Argument and, but maybe thinking about when collaborating, you know, even if something that I don't know how to do, I don't know how to use, like, could have been this VR for someone who mainly does immersive theater is how do I make sure that I actually can access this afterwards?
14.910477638244629;-40.005008697509766;13;How can we set up the collaboration in a way that is actually how I would like to continue, basically? So, just, just a series of reflection on, on that. But, um, but, and then finally another work, um, that we presented for the festival was an mixed reality area that was curated by this plow, this organization that work with neuro divergent filmmakers. And they presented an era with, with works by different artists, which you can read in the slide. And this was also quite interesting because again, This plot work with mainly neuro diversion filmmakers. So people are artists with dyslexia, dyspraxia, uh, in the autism spectrum, d h d, different kind of, of, uh, neuro diversities. Uh, and of course when, when we saw the film, when we talk about the film, there weren't many. Considerations or access provision beyond, uh, those that are of course for people with, um, non neurotypical brains. Of course, there was lots of consideration about, you know, uh, sound and, and visual, um, inputs of sort of, um, sensory overwhelm as well.
13.91708755493164;-42.518707275390625;13;That's why they created as well this sort of cylinder to, to sort of allow a much more relaxed experience. But, uh, there were no description, no subtitles. So we had a, a really interesting conversation with this plan about that. And, um, not all the pieces at the end ended up having subtitles, um, or the description because that's ultimately, that's an artistic choice. And, and that goes back to what I was saying, it's not just an add-on. Um, but it's thinking about, um, do you want the piece to be experienced audio and sound and, and text and visual Or as an artist, are you also happy for only one of the experience, for only bits of the experience? Cause ultimately, in front of a work, we all know that everyone has a different experience. So attempting to replicate the same experience for everyone, adding all these as access provision doesn't make sense. If the artist is at before different. Experiences of the work. So, so some artists were very happy to have subtitles. Some artists were like, I'm just happy with the visual. Uh, some artists decided to do all your description themselves, so giving almost like a very personal interpretation of the work.
10.928401947021484;-41.26536560058594;13;They might not have been what you are actually seeing with your eyes, but it might have been another view that you can hear or others having an audio describer. So someone that professionally describes what you can see. So again, really interesting takes, and it's not necessary to have all the access provision, but to have that conversation and be aware that if you present a work in certain way, it might not be accessible for some people or it might be acc access, access differently. But it was really interesting for the artists as well to have the conversation. Of course, access comes with costs, uh, and that's really important to say. So sometimes there's no access provision as well for budget limitations. Um, Just to say if you do Arts Council applications, access can be added on top. So it's not on the actual budget and the limit of your project grant. So that's also something to think about cuz there's a separate budget for access in Arts Council, which is good. So, oh, I can't see you again. Sorry. I'm gonna move you. Um, I thought this might be helpful for you being, being artist of course.
16.028348922729492;-38.536529541015625;13;And I'm sure you had to go, you saw probably daily or like very often go through application processes. Just telling you a little bit about, um, the process with the mayor of London. So very sort of, uh, uh, established, um, processes in, uh, in, um, open course that then goes the same for us. Council, like foundation, big, bigger, uh, funding, uh, providers that as well liable to then, um, show if, if ask how they do things. So it's really important that the processes in place look and are legit. Um, so we do that. We did an open call for the mayor of London. We had around 80,000 pounds to give to, um, eight artists, seven artists, more or less, um, to make it really accessible. Um, we had two month. Uh, sub submission window from when we put out the call to then give type two artists to think about an idea and submit.
14.864731788635254;-36.643959045410156;13;So a really nice, uh, span to really think about the project. We also had a q and a drop in session during this time where artists could just come in and talk to me, uh, and solution producer about their ideas, if they were leg eligible, if they were relevant, so we could give some sort. Just opinions and feedback. Uh, the call was disseminated on a website as an attachment as well, a word attachment. Cause if p d F are not readable often for screen readers, so people that use screen readers need, uh, uh, word document language, very simple and readable. There was no need for us to go through art talks and mentioning, um, dollars and guari or philosophical principle that really weren't necessary. So really using something that was readable and, and easy. Uh, we disseminated the call through an easy read format, which you might be familiar or might not. It's a very, it's a, it's, um, it's a form for learning disabled, uh, people. It's often images on the left and, and short text in boxes on the right that explains the crucial points where b s L interpretation of the call audio files, different ways of submitting.
15.84445858001709;-37.384029388427734;13;So yes, it was writing, but also video, audio. So, um, for people that find writing difficult, could also send us an audio answering to the questions or a video. And, uh, thinking about distribution, that was really important because when you put out open call, when you, uh, when you're doing an event and you want people to come, it's not enough to just post it on. Instagram if you don't have a million followers. Um, but there needs to be work on the distribution. It's not enough to just post it online. And that's it. So really thinking through who is, who are the people who would like to apply to this? So really thinking about listing, inviting, uh, reaching out, um, to the people that we wanted, which was disabled people, deaf, neuro divergent, again, under the social models. So it's not that we were asking some sort of medical examination, but, and it went from people with dyslexia to people with, um, multiple disabilities, um, people with autism. So a very sort of varied, um, . Then we went for this selection process. So again, very, uh, legitimate. We need to be audited for this. Uh, so showing how we did the process to, to, as a mayoral sort of concern.
14.43593978881836;-37.771060943603516;13;So we had different assessors from different backgrounds. It was me as the main festival curator and a producer for Lewis, but also people in the mayor's office, um, social servants. So diversity, not everyone was an art expert. Uh, and that's why as well, in application, it's very important that the language is not too complex. It's not too arty, uh, because if it's not a PhD application, for example or something that it's very, um, sartorially defined, generally speaking. Flora Council, you know, fund. It's not a artist that read there, it's not curators that read there. It's, it's, it's it's officers. Um, that's why what you wanna do, how you wanna do, and needs to be very clean and clear. Um, that doesn't mean that you, you need to sort of throw complexities away, but just the language needs to be clear. The more sophisticated and, uh, bar language used in application least successful, um, because of this diversity of assessors, uh, this criteria general is zero, is um, Insufficient free is excellent.
16.60250473022461;-41.603153228759766;13;So you go in between and you go for fifth stages. One is eligibility. So the first thing like, is this person disabled? Uh, is this person based in London and is this person applying with an r and d project? So making sure that, you know, it's not pitching our finished work, he's not award that already exists. So going through eligibility first, making sure that the basic, um, criteria are. Then going through the criteria of the commission. Uh, so looking through the application, it's what are the questions? You know, is the work ambition and regional? Is the work about lewisham or is the work performance, so all this criteria will be evaluated.And then finally the financial sort of viability. Budget. Is this project actually possible to realize within 10 k, um, with the artist pay and all the consideration, you know, is it realistic? Uh, and then, then we went through the, the, the most exciting bit for me, which is the development. So thinking about the artist, how to best support them through the process.Through the process. So thinking about their access needs, um, and, and trying to meet them, which I don't think is quantum physics. You, you really need to be present there, available. There's lots of that has to do with dialogue and, and really being able to relate to different people, collaborators, which is a lot of what we do. I think that's quite something quite special of artists and, and create how we communicate. We're capable of having different. Levels of communication and openness and then thinking about, um, access for audiences. Um, so how would the audience experience the work, which is of course crucial as well.
17.681739807128906;-39.46177673339844;13;I briefly wanted to mention quickly just another project, because I know of course you're doing a digital platform, so this might be as well relevant. Then again, talks a little bit about access. Um, this is a project called Where I'm coming from. This is the second edition. We did the first one in 2020, uh, and only happened online. And, um, the project is about, uh, sort of languages, migrant languages that are spoken in the uk but they're not necessarily, um, much involved in arts, these courses being primarily English dominated. So it was about, again, accessibility into the arts as a, as a sector and how it's actually, um, Artists as well, speaks these languages of certain barriers in accessing.So the second edition was with Thai is an language, and we, we, we involved artists that speak those languages. They are from, they're either living in London, but the majority were living abroad. And we developed this platform, uh, where you could experience the work. Um, and again, thinking about accessing multiple levels in this, in this situation, there was also the language barrier. We actually wanted the platform to be first in the language and then English afterwards to sort of make the English speaking audience feeling a bit at unease, uh, when entering the space, almost like turning upside down. The feeling that, uh, lots of non-English speaker might have if when entering certain very sort of white cubes or so. Again, a really, really interesting pro processor. We had a website. We of course, you know, all the little sort of, um, small modification to make it more accessible from the font size, the contrast and the work as well had, um, yeah, there's a video had a different provision. So, you know, um, again, this is first the airway text and then in English, the performances were audio described was created by the artist So again, the performances were, or the describe a professional audio describe, uh, um, and all the sort of access provision we were talking about before. But again, quite an interesting exercise in thinking about accessibilities in, in other terms, um, I guess. 
13.343266487121582;-37.88673782348633;13;Now I, I wanted to briefly mention the research. I can't see you all. Let me just quickly check if you're still there. Yes. . Um, so I came basically to do a PhD, um, after recognizing issues in the industry, especially in the traditional, uh, side of the industry. So I've worked for galleries, commercial galleries, fast, like freeze, all these, um, environ. Recognizing issues at the, at the basis of what we do. The fact that artists and curators we exist, we basically have two options to exist. One, it's either going through the commercially viable private domain where me, the majority, I don't wanna be negative. You know, a artworks are considered commodity to be exchanged and traded. Uh, this field as well is full of private patronage that can come from very dubious backgrounds, and the reasoning behind it might not be as ethical. So we're sort of at the mercy of this, this patronage, or on the other side, more public funded government sort of, um, solutions which are very project-based, outcome-oriented. You cannot really present work that is politically or socially challenging. Always needs to be quite of a palatable aesthetic and, and concerns. And then finally, um, Somehow in this, in public course, there's lots of ideas as well bestowed to artists of how the world should change community, or should liberate, um, re despite of the father actor.
13.50650405883789;-38.56587600708008;13;Artists have very limited possibilities. You know, sometimes it's, you know, many ways of engagement, of, of budget, of resources. So there's lots of expectations, um, that often are sort of tick ticking boxes exercises. So that's realizing that then I, I decided to start a PhD. Of course I had, of course, I mean, I had no possibility to start it by myself, so I had to apply, uh, for scholarship and I got it miraculously during C O V D, um, which was quite of a privilege and it's still a privilege. I'm now in my third year, so as part of the PhD, this is the title, it's quite dense and it's still t bbc, uh, but I'm basically thinking about how to enable. Art psychologists or EC colleges of artists, uh, curators, professionals, institutions that are more responsive to industry 5.0. And here I'm using the best term of industry. I'm literally leveraging on a term that is quite buzzing right now, um, to think about speculative scenarios. So thinking about the principle of industry five or web three. So this, this world where we would be so interconnected and, uh, AI would sort of, um, take over lots of daunting jobs and, um, probably, uh, will have a web that is decentralized and distributed.
11.883822441101074;-38.1838264465332;13;How can we actually leverage on those concept that who knows if they will actually. Come to life, but how can we leverage some of them or some of those conceptions to think about how artists and curator could do things differently, could institute new, new ways of coming together that are more independent from this sort of viable, uh, bmal alternatives that I just mentioned. So, uh, so my, as part of the research I have, of course research question that I just wanted to share with you, uh, one would be how to best perform the curatorial method, which is different from curating. Um, there's lots of debate in, in Atory discourses, um, To institute new distributed horizontal organizations between artists or practitioners that are open-ended system ecosystem of cross-disciplinary exchange and collaboration and social technical innovation as well.
13.887773513793945;-38.3498420715332;13;So how can we bring technology in? Cause the truth is that there is also quite of a gap in literacy in the use of technologies for many, many artists. Uh, many artists are reluctant to use technologies, um, technologies primarily used for research or to speed up processes, but, um, but only a, a very sort of niche, uh, really uses technologies as a medium. Um, and already in 2012, Claire Bishop posted, um, published an article, I think it was at monthly, about his reluctancy from the contemporary art artwork to sort of accept technology and really using it. Um, Secondly, how can we benefit from this speculative scenarios of industry five to think about, um, principle of decentralized infrastructure and what that could do for us, uh, artist are workers and curators. What would happen when we when we remove gatekeepers? What, you know, thinking about question of labor governance hierarchies, and I'm a curator as well, so I'm, I'm quite, uh, aware of gatekeeping. Uh, so what would happen if, if we utilize this principle? And finally, how can artists and art workers be assets in wider societal discourses?
12.751579284667969;-39.844234466552734;13;So, um, how can we move beyond the museum and the galleries? The only spaces where artists and curators operate? and work somewhere else. What if we were placed in real life scenarios? What if we work, we were to work in, uh, uh, other contexts beyond the outcome? Of course there will be many outcome, one outcome, who knows? But how can that, can, can we move beyond the sort of transactional discourse? Oh, I'm coming here to produce this sculpture and then I'll be gone. And all the images and sculpture and all you consider for is your making. So this is primarily what I'm looking at and um, and I came up with a few, um, practice ideas because the PhDs practice based. So one is unlike do.work, um, which is something quite experimental still, uh, but it's a network. Uses principles of DAOs, decentralized autonomous organization and NFTs, but it's not an NFT platform nor a dao. And the idea is that on the platform, members can exchange skills, expertise, um, organization can also join the network offering spaces in exhibition festival of physical spaces through an offering system.
13.667244911193848;-39.406288146972656;13;Uh, so rather than us having to comply to criteria, we propose offers, whoever is can answer the offer then can, can sort of reply and initiate a collaborative relationship. The platform through crypto also allows funds, um, for new project. So not only you can offer, okay, well I wanna do an installation, um, that involves sounds, fluids, and, uh, Uh, dance, but I need a dancer and a scientist, uh, to help me to develop what I'm looking for. So you put an offer on a, like scientists and dancers might see, uh, you can, can check your profile. Might be interesting collaborating, uh, and might get in touch with you. You might find your right collaborators. You might need fund to produce this installation. So you can also ask fund to the network, uh, and the, the members of the network can bid for your proposal to be realized or not. So it's very similar to a DAO that you have an existing treasury, but DAOs work through voting mechanisms, which can be very. Don't think, and if you're not interested in a proposal, um, why would you vote for it? Uh, Dao as in principle, as being decentralized, autonomous organization as well, shouldn't really have much, um, conversation.
17.11261558532715;-40.45284652709961;13;Like lots of it is on the algorithm, which is problematic. Um, sort of things needs to be discussed. So that's why I claim it not to be a do. Um, so now it's a co it's a concept. Uh, if you're going and like the work, you'll just see the, the brief of the project. But actually. Who knows if we will find some investors to actually put this platform in real life. And if we will, I will invite you all and hopefully we can, we'll make some great projects, you know. Um, and then something else is something a bit more pragmatic. It would be a protocol, uh, that I'm drafting with, with different people for artists to work in outer context. There is no galleries of museum, as you might know now if you are work, um, if you wanna work, you are contracted, uh, with two things. You either have a commissioning contract or a service agreement. Both contracts are very, sort of one directional. Some working towards a protocol that could be used by artists to work in out settings from industry to also, uh, hospitals, uh, to think about ethics, publics participation, who is for processes, um, labor pay. And it draws a lot from a p g, the artist placement group. This movement from the seventies that was already placing artists in, uh, in, um, governmental offices or companies. And so I guess I've talked already a lot, so I guess this is me. Does anyone have a question? Have I completely bored you?
27.282148361206055;-25.713281631469727;13;No, it was, thank you very much, Linda. Yeah. It was really many things that, uh, I wasn't aware in like such a compact, simple way as well. So thanks for that. Yeah. Oh, thank you. Thanks for listening. Yeah, thank you. It's, it's interesting, uh, to see kind of holistic video of, um, bootcamp the environment that we're possibly situated as, um, people who make work. Relation to, or you have certain art practice. Um, yeah. And, and interesting thinking of the accessibility of thinking from the beginning. And I really enjoyed you talking, listening to you talking about the different project. I didn't, um, continue after the r and d because, because there's too much happened in the r and d. I feel like that's something I like for this research group that, um, our workshop they had through the past, uh, like almost a year, every time the workshop is very, um, like I, I, every time I feel like oh, so much ideas and energy and like kind of carrying that along over a longer period of time, I think that's also something to consider in addition to making work out of it. Like how to keep that kind of strine to toward versus sustainability of that. Yeah. Thank you. Cool, thank you. 
18.031538009643555;-35.76491165161133;13;So I guess now we can go a little bit about fun bits, but hopefully I won't be talking as much. So I'm gonna put in the chat and copy board link a link, which can you tell me if you can access it. Oh no wait, sorry. There's no access written massive Now this link you should be able to access and if editing capacity like myself. Yeah, I can see three people in. So this is a admir board. I dunno if some of you might have used it already. It's free, which is quite amazing. It's one of the best, uh, people like flow charts, uh, diagrams or, it's really great. Um, and allows just, um, equal access. There's also paid version, but it's for working with teams and you don't really need it. If, if you're not, um, yeah, don't never fully realize why it's the paid version, cuz you can work with teams even now. So it's probably bigger. But basically there's lots of, you know, you can just text, you can have sticky notes, shapes, you can also draw, um, all sorts of stuff. Um, you can put images in there emoji. Um, I can, maybe, I can, you know, all sorts of Yeah. Frames, images, emojis. I will say it's very fluid. And I think it would be a bit fun to play up with it a little bit and then thinking more reflectively to you, to the group of peers of hyperspace, what you've done. I looked at the, at the worship you've done across the year, which is quite amazing.
13.34586238861084;-34.02522659301758;13;It's, it's, it's such an important work and resource. That you are building. Um, so I was thinking to go through three phases. Maybe we start with the first playing space, um, which is the value bank. And I would ask you to freely, you don't need to voice it out, you can just write, we don't, we don't necessarily see who's writing what. Uh, if you could think about the exchanges that took place amongst you as a cohort and the people that came can be, exchange can be very broad. It can be types of exchanges, it can be very transactional, uh, listen and learning and hearing, but it can be much more, again, vague and open. And if you could ride them in this playing space, um, To think about what the value that was generated. Basically the, the aim is to really think about the value that wasgenerated within this cohort in this year. Um, so yeah, I will leave you maybe five minutes for this exercise and feel free to dive in. And again, um, it can be, doesn't need to be necessarily straightforward and you can add images, drawings, or whatever you feel like.
15.316421508789062;-12.330426216125488;13;One second. Where, how do I find this? Oh, how do I, how do I react? I love it. Display. There was a, there was a meta display. So do you see the tea? I know. Ok. I think I know. Yeah. I think there was another, yeah, let me, okay. Yeah, there's the t You can put sticky notes as well. You can change the color. Mm-hmm. I'm also gonna write some suggestions as a question mark so we can talk about it later. Or exchanges. But also thinking about values, maybe that might be a bit useful if, if thinking about exchanges is not, um, Just making your writing a bit bigger, walking with your writing. Yeah. Let's go back.Um, hi Linda. I just wanted to ask you, what do you mean by values? I don't think I quite, so what do you think? What did you find valuable by being in the hyper space? Okay. What do you think it was worth your time? Your what? What did you, what are you gonna take home? Okay. Uh, so think what? Yeah. Thanks. Course. I'm gonna actually put some music on just so we may do a little bit. No fun.Okay. I think. Five plus minutes were really interesting. I love the look of this mile board.
-13.39492130279541;6.976766109466553;13;So let's see what we have here. Learn new things, finding ways to share tactile things, understanding the digital sphere, how to connect online and offline, finding ways of translation, curiosity of the unknown, and working with process. Well, this is very interesting. I mean, so, so Rich. Think about it as, as something that you bring home. It's the whole process of learning as well. It's, it's quite special. Knowledge, skills, experiences, words, listening, presence, experimental without a concrete outcome, processes valued, part of creation, not judgmental approach to collaborative thinking, experiencing, welcoming, brilliant, and not judgmental approach as well. It's, it's quite of a thing to achieve. It's, it's not easy in a collaborative environment. Feeling comfortable with a nonphysical space. So generating a safe space, which again, it's, it's, uh, it's a mission in itself. What even is a safe space? How does it look like reconnecting over a prolonged period of time, totally sustained relations to see familiar faces, to feel comfortable, to be with each other, to learn things that might not come in your research or periphery.
-13.90381145477295;4.876445770263672;13;How, how important is that to leave your sort of comfort zone to make art in a digital space or an artwork can be? God, I love that. This is my, this is my lifelong inquiry of what an artwork can be. If you think historically as well, you know, artwork has been a, you know, advanced to be participation as an artwork, artwork as you know, social relations, as artwork. So it's so good. I love the arrows here. This. I am pretty sure there was Ada knowing Ada loved the little arrows going around. Nice emoji photos as well. Sense of collective being care, mutual understanding, discern between the virtual and physical being together patients community. So this is a really nice picture as the value bank. This is your value bank. Um, this doesn't have any monetary equivalent, um, because how can you put a price on things like this?
12.415616989135742;-34.561553955078125;13;You know, learning is pretty sure at the rca it is around 60 K, uh, three years, uh, 60,000 pounds. Um, so this is, there's lots of value in here, which is really interesting and you can keep coming back and add things. I think this is very, it is useful to also realize what you've achieved, what you've gained, um, through the process. And then I guess we can move to play space two. We just saw somehow, was this a mistake? Yeah. So thinking about, um, how to hold on into this value bank, how to frame, convey, highlight those values, those principles within an exhibition context. That is what you are going to an exhibition or an event context, which is what you're gonna face soon. Um, how to make this principle accessible to others through the exhibition. Of course, this is, this is much more challenging cuz I know it's, you might not have an answer. Um, But it's also a reflection on the exhibition itself. Is the exhibition actually the final point or is gonna be a further site for your research to continue for upper space experimentation to continue? Um, just, just thinking more about than the exhibition event.
11.925750732421875;-34.09998321533203;13;Um, and are you, do you know what you're going to present, for example? Um, um, yeah. Is it about performing some of them, um, creating some relations, how to achieve that, which is incredibly difficult question. I'm, I'm very aware.And how to make them accessible to others. I guess that's also one of the questions. How can you enact patience in an exhibition? I'm not sure. Community. Is it through promotion? Is it through setting up a space? I don't know. Just some ideas. I'm gonna put another song. Five more minutes.20seconds.Okay. I guess here as well. There's lots of interesting stuff. I leave you some time to finish whilst we go through it again. You are very welcome to keep going on with it. How to frame, convey, and highlight those. 
-0.3003205358982086;-2.491091251373291;13;Coexistence of different works is one installation of experiences, total work of art, expressing links between each of us. Really interesting thinking about the curation, how can be sort of c page of a work to the other practice into the other. Almost like an obvious string, which is a little bit what, but here, which is also a little bit, this sort of diagram of circles, layering of different formats and media, which is also question on not a reality, but individuality. Um, thinking about hospitality, layering of sensorial experiences as well, sharing spaces, hearing voices, feeling presence. how to invite others. Is it the same experience? Well, yeah. The question of thinking about other other's experiences as they come in, not only yours as the producer of, of whatever works that you will producing, but what is that You want other to, to experience?
-12.58917236328125;6.211169719696045;13;Yeah, exactly. Further and to consider new combinations changing. And I guess this is, this is about as well changing positions, so being in multiple positions. Questions of positionality. Look, the exhibition is another chapter, not the final point. Certainly multiple outcomes can be personalized. Reconcile, really interesting word. Transaction between, uh, thinking about what type of transactions do you want in the exhibition? Is it that people come in and just are viewers or spectators or are they actually participants? Is there an actual transaction between the work and them and you? Is it even a you as in yourself, individual artist or is you as a cohort? I guess these are all quite question important questions to consider, and I feel this is really useful. This looks very fertile as a, as a place space to think about the exhibition and what's coming and what you've done.
12.066153526306152;-34.920982360839844;13;And I guess we can spend the last five minutes on the last play space and then, you know, maybe have a few comments if you feel like it. Um, on the, the legacy. So we found the values, the exchanges with our bank. We thought about how to make it public, to make it accessible to others, and what does them mean, what type of invitations we want to give to others. And then it's going back to how can these values actually live beyond the exhibition? How can they not just dissipate after the 20th of February? Um, How can these exchanges really stay? Uh, so not only thinking pragmatically about legacy, which of course can be questions of documentation. And of course you have a platform now, but I guess it's also about the relations, the transactions that are directly mentioned here, the links, how can they leave beyond the, the format of the exhibition or the event, which is of course temporarily, uh, condensed.
5.9917893409729;-12.76023006439209;13;So yeah, maybe we can do five more minutes. I'm gonna keep going with this playlist. 30 seconds more and then we can come to a our projects trailer, huh? buddy. Yeah, we're projects trailer Yeah. Ali, this, I love the movement and, and everything growing. It's, it's really a life to working in this way. It's almost like Google Dogs, but in a more playful way. Oh yeah. The, the, the affordances of the Miro are, are great. It's also very easy to mess it up as you maybe saw at the beginning, you know, to move someone's stuff or to cancel and delete. But, uh, but once you get a grip of it, it's quite fun to, to play and come back and it's very quick as well. Easy to learn. No, it's great. And I mean, look at this, this is a gorgeous frame. It's a really nice, Hmm. , does anyone want to share or to elaborate more on what they write rather than me reading it out? Hmm.Um, I, I included some bits of the lived memories, the bodily memories and the traces that are imprinted in us in the memory. Probably unconsciously, but definitely infinitely. So we still don't know what the hyperspace will grow into, but all these experiences we had throughout, they somehow will feed into.
12.497617721557617;5.269236087799072;13;Different projects and maybe we will even not be aware what it was. But every experience reshapes us and re reshapes the future. So I, I guess we just have to wait to live this legacy soon. And I, I imagined our group, our group of 13 people, as these like little seeds. And when we, when we are going to separate, I mean, when the hyper space, it's current stage will finish, we'll be like these seeds blown by the wind, and then each of us will sprout into a different, have a different little plant. Hmm. What a gorgeous image. Oh, a bit, a bit is a little bit like thinking of, of so many of these sessions happened on Zoom, almost like in aquarium being, uh, being in this cage of a screen. And now I feel these tiny little seeds are freed and like , like birds, they're on the wind, they fly away and they will find the soil to root in and, and yes, and create something new out of this, like this little fe fetus of, uh, creativity and inspiration.
1.7611851692199707;-4.857076644897461;13;Mm-hmm. . Yeah, I, I agree with you agat. It's really hard actually to, to see what the outcomes of this process will be cuz they actually expands so much in time and they, they really linger on through, through multiple experiences that will come in the future. I think I've seen these happen. Multiple times when they just sprout new seedlings. Eventually they're there in like a sort of potential. It's like a, a new seed has been created, or multiple seeds have been created. They're all there and they will sprout in their own times when the sort of the climate is right, or if it rains or if it is sunny. So I think that's a beautiful way of sort of, of looking at it. You never know when it's gonna sort of burst open. There's all these potentials to come. Yeah. I think what, that's what's beautiful about it, the fact that we work with potentialities instead of, uh, done and finished things because, um, there's always more to come. Hmm. And as, as someone mentioned, the final event, . It's, it's just another chap. It's another chapter. It's like another workshop from which we will learn from.
12.325910568237305;5.212647438049316;13;It's another experience that will reshape us and then, and then it will continue, and then there will be another project and another encounter. And it's, it's this collection accumulation, um, something that the digital is, is an interesting image of, of storing, storing things into infinity. Hmm. It's like almost like our bodies are, um, maybe not the bodies, but bone are starting thing in into infinity. Mmmm. These are these a really wonderful image. And then, and you said that there's this potential, this embryonic potential to then just burst. It's really at the core, I feel like, of a creative, the creative act or creative relations. You know what it does, it does feel a little bit like a fetus, fetus chapter for us because we, we met in a closed group.
26.465246200561523;-27.321807861328125;13;We were enclosed, almost like in a mother's womb. We were, uh, cozy, always seeing the same faces. We, we were very familiar with each other. It started to feel really, really like a close knit, almost, um, friendship based family. But now when we have to go out into a public venue, To, to welcome others into this space. It, it does feel like Beth and, and Beth is always, it always coincides with a big cry, and shock . It's a new, an environment for us. And also if we met, if we met before in a physical space, it was also a forest or some garden or, um, or a, someone's, someone's domestic space. So it'll be a new experience for the whole group and the project, definitely. Mm, Wow, that's so wonderful. Someone else. Um, When you say friendship, I uh, just remind me of quicker house, um, of like, I was thinking of how you say in a womb, but I feel like a quicker meeting that people would just, would stand up and speak of your, what they they're feeling. Um, well without kind of religious or one like thought that drive us all together.
31.176956176757812;-2.4021172523498535;13;It's kind of, there's something and that's probably like kind of able to have the space. I, I feel quite po Before I was like, oh, it's kind of finishing the, the group to have like kind of recurring of like kind of getting the habit of doing, have like one session that's all exciting but also quite interesting thinking that we can all have, not franchising, but the idea of having more of like nods of um, like networks. That's like the ideal or idea of a have space. I can emerge. , um, in multiple sites in the future, but in different names. Mm-hmm.Well, yeah. Yeah. Go. I started Please. I I was just, um, I was just thinking, it's interesting that a lot of us didn't quite know each other, but how we sort of entered this cloud that became really a communal mind. Like we've been through these various experiences together, which has been probably 10 or more. So even if we don't consciously think about it, we have this sort of communal. Blur of things going around that I think will really translate into what we sort of create and how we, we sort of come to experience these new ways of sensing or thinking about how to share work, how to share experiences, how to tactily be and experience the world.
29.803524017333984;-2.416109800338745;13;And I think that's, that's it. It brought us more present to our work. At least I speak for myself, but I feel like we we're in this kind of sort of bubble stage of, so sort of very, um, bubbly, like effervescent what could come out of it. I think it'll, it'll sort of, um, not only show itself in February, but it'll also continue to, to expand from that and to have new ways of becoming Yeah, amongst us. I think that's great. Like the ways of becoming like some sort of creator. So it was still continuing that, you know, the, from the embryo to then this, this creator that small phase in Yeah, like some sort of meteorological So good. I really, I really loved Sarah, your, um, metaphor of a cloud. Because, because it is a little bit like the, this, the space we share, it became some kind of a cloud. We, uh, we connect at a distance, but we share consciousness. We, um, we exchange through, through, through our voice and it is some kind of a cloud, a cloud of thoughts that we shape together and it'll. It'll be blown ex expand, re reshape itself, but it'll be somewhere there. Yes. In space. Hmm hmm. Yeah. I think having started in hyperspace or sort of this digital space where it sort of feels like a bit airy, but it also feels like a sort of as if you're in your own mind, but there's this communal hive of a mind that's sort of not quite physical yet cuz we're not sharing physical spaces, but it's sort of exists as in Yeah.
25.783475875854492;-27.38565444946289;13;Yeah. And also like your work, Linda, unlike, unlike. It looks extra interesting and, and I would be really, I would be looking forward to hearing more, more about it because with, with Anya, we were also starting the project thinking about this virtual space that could be some kind of a compliment and at points of pandemic or, or some kind of cri, either crisises, it could be an, uh, uh, a substitute, uh, of a place of encounter exchanging and doing things together. I, I feel like we've learned a lot how challenging working with digital technology is. It was a big learning, but maybe your, your research, Linda will also come up with some ideas how to make, how to make the, the online. , like, um, like a real, really horizontal place of peer-to-peer exchange because this project is, is really much related to this idea. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. It's so complex, as you said. And, um, so little resources to develop side stuff. Like, it's so corporate already. I mean, the web as, as it is now, it's so corporate and capitalized. Mm-hmm. You know, this is who owns the data. The, um, you know, it's, that's why, you know, I look at web three as an option to a web that is more decentralized, more distributors le less, um, owned by corporations.
15.131576538085938;-33.39995193481445;13;So that's literally the, the current web now. So that's where community could really thrive. And Peer to peer has been doing lots of stuff online since, since Sages and. You know, there's, there's, um, this very interesting group called the Hollow Chain that are really developing a peer to peer system.They've been doing it for like three or four years, and the process is so, so long and, uh, so much commitment, uh, from, from all parties to build this, this network or system. But it's, um, yeah, there's, I think for, for us as well as, as pretty much people in the arts, there's a, we need lots of collaboration because we generally, if you're not necessarily, um, new media artists or you, you don't have the literacy, like, you know, you, you need skills to be able to build certain stuff with a, like, it's so complex cause it's really powered the, it's not necessarily powered by the blockchain, but there are blockchain elements which you need developers that can do that sort of stuff.
15.334386825561523;-32.974639892578125;13;And, uh, Uh, and there are some open source developers that are kind of into, you know, but it's, it's, it's complicated. Cause developers as well are, you know, the majority work for companies that pay them a lot of money to do these platforms, , you know, and um, so finding people that are really keen to get on board for, to experiment is not that easy. It's like right now the web is really, really sort of so cap capitalistic in its design. And it's the way in which our data treated is, you know, algorithm profiling us constantly harvesting our data to them, give us, feed us content really. And it's all about the attention economies, like we're pasted to our computer and devices. How amazing would it be a web that actually doesn't generate these addictions, but. , as you said, it's a space where you can share, you can exchange, you can trade things beyond monetary, just buying stuff because I'm receiving all these ads that profile me. You know, that's, that's where I, I, I fantasize on that a lot.
-13.117938995361328;5.547438144683838;13;Like, you know, it's, it's a space that I really enjoy. Even though I'm, I honestly might understand 10% of what it actually means because I really don't have the technical knowledge to fully get it. But, but it's still, I think it's really important that we still are in that space and we experiment. Cause otherwise you cannot build new spaces. Only with people that have met technical knowledge that you need a d adversity of players to avoid. Then the same mistakes that were into building the, the web that we are now, web two. Cause the initial worldwide web was decentralized in itself. Web one, you know, uh, was mainly experience. But then with, with when corporation put the hands off on the content making, that's why we sort of lost any power in agency saying so who knows?
24.67066192626953;-27.741186141967773;13;So my, my, my life in general, it's, it's, it's really distant from technology at all. But I feel that hyperspace has, has been happening in a very crucial time. It's, it's when all of these nascent technologies act developing extremely, and even we were experimenting with open AI tools and even two weeks ago, or a little bit earlier, they introduced a tool where you can code with your voice. So you don't even need an expertise anymore. And to imagine throughout this project, imagine what the future can bring. It's, it's pretty exciting. So, yeah. Um, I'm, I'm grateful. I'm grateful to also force myself to, to open to to, to fields that I was not really familiar with. And I've been amaz some, sometimes what. What could be done in, into the online. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. I think, um, oh, sorry Adam. No, I just a quick comment that that is where it's a political like proposition, able to use exchange as which to exchange value or share value, which is something that many people have tried. And, um, but I think they need to be having more attempt. Um, that, um, just, I, I also think Marxism of like the kind of communism of like a shared value and allocated value and how, how, if that's possible, even in this kind of virtual environment as experiment would be interesting.
19.571025848388672;-39.1312255859375;13;Would you, would you be able to share, um, share it with us if I would be interested in reading that today? You go. It was, well it's of course, it's um, I have an open here, so it was 2012. Oh wow. I'm very conscious of the time and we didn't even have a quick break, so you must be either starving or needing a toilet break as much as I am. Uh, so yes, I'm just concluding thoughts. It was really nice to seeing meeting some of you. Um, I, I, I'm so sorry I can't be there in the event I'm gutted, but I hope to see some documentation and something we can, mics we live stream some bits for you, maybe Yes. Yes. I can't wait to hear all about it really. and, and congratulations. I mean, it sounds, this sounds like an incredible proI just want to mention that, um, I think your research is really interesting, Linda, in the sense of how, cuz I'm also not very new technology oriented and I sort of moved into a middle of a forest. But I think it's really important also to think how these new technologies and platforms really are able to shape our lives or how in our work we're not only set on the, on the platforms we know and that have a, a lot of it become capitalized or we're capitally driven from the start. And how to really search for these new ways of sharing and connecting and um, yeah. And really sort of how arts continues in the world, in these new formats that can really have bring new agencies and bring new modes of, um, sharing. They're not based on old models that we don't wanna sort of continue to propagate.So it's, it's important to sort of be atten attentive to, yeah. To how technology is developing and, and how we're able to sort of, um, maybe subvert it or use the, um, the non, the non-linear ones, the non sort of hi wounds. Yeah. Um, I also wanted to ask, you mentioned Claire Bishop's article on technology.
2.8552849292755127;-17.52297592163086;13;Yes and you really created something really valuable and meaningful by being together. It's uh, it's really exciting and it will have ripple effects. It will. And that's the most exciting thing, I guess, about as well, what we do. Um, so those ripple effects. Mushroom, like funk, funk, you know? Mm-hmm. . Yeah. Yeah. That was also esteem at points. the project. Yeah. Mm-hmm. . Linda, will you be able to, to come to our event? No, I'm, uh, I'm, unfortunately I'm in the US Ah, . Yeah. Yeah. And I so gutted when, when told me, um, that's why I said I can't wait to hear everything about it, cuz Yeah. It won't be, We'll send you hyperspace versions of it. I'm sure they'll be . Yeah. We connecting hyperspace waste. , yeah. Mm-hmm. . Cool. Cool. Then thank you very much. This was a really special, I, it was great to, to have this last session in the project to be this like really, um, proper evaluation. Yeah. I think it worked really nicely because you were, we were meant to do it earlier and I think it's actually quite amazing that that was like the last meeting with someone from the outside of the group.
2.0601916313171387;-16.770919799804688;13;Mm-hmm. . Yeah. I'm glad, I'm glad it worked. I, I look through what you've done and I feel it would be good to trying to understand, or I dunno, Is there a way to save these boards so we could keep it? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I can send them to you. I can also send them in high rest. Um Oh, that will be great. Oh, yeah. Oh, they can, they can exist. Uh, some project traces. Mm-hmm. , could you, you, sorry, could you also send the PDF of your presentation? Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. Because I think I missed some of it and I just to see I can note someone forget and don't again to get in touch. Uh, and just, yeah. I hope to see you around. Uh, yes, definitely. Oh, and see you soon, I hope. Yeah. Yes, yes. Have a great evening ahead. Thank you, Linda. Linda. It was really great you, Linda. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, bye.
